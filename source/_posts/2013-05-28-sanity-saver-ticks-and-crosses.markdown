*Sanity Savers are quick tips that help you stay sane when using your computer.*

I often create point form lists of things, whether planning a post or a coding sprint or a client activity. And to keep track of which points in the list are done and which will not be done, or what is right and what is wrong, I like to use `✓` and `✗` symbols.

I use them so frequently and am so lazy that even typing `,,tick` and `,,cross` [TextExpander](http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=V41G*FiMqjc&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Ftextexpander-for-mac%252Fid405274824%253Fmt%253D12%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30) expansions are too much effort.

So I made them hot keys using [Keyboard Maestro](http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/). `⌃⌘=` gives me a `✓` and `⌃⌘-` gives a `✗`. Anywhere. Anytime.

<span class="light">**Update:** As per the comment from Jimmy Hartingdon below, change the macro to 'Insert Text by Typing' if you want the clipboard to remain unchanged.</span>

✗ Cool  
✓ Nerdy  
✗ Fashionable  
✓ Fun

<span class="light">Batsu (罰) is Japanese for the ✗ symbol, meaning "wrong", as in wrong answer (Wikipedia).</span>
