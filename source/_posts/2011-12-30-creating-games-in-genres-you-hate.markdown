Ben Kuchera, writing in Ars Technical in [SpellTower on iOS shows power of creating games in genres you hate](http://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2011/12/spelltower-on-ios-shows-the-power-of-creating-games-in-genres-you-hate.ars) resonates with me because I do *dislike* word games, yet I really enjoy [SpellTower](http://spelltower.com/).

"It's not just about knowing words, it's about knowing when and where to use words," Gage explained. "The difficulty also gives the game a weight that I don't think games like Bookworm have. Because it has constant micro goals—such as don't let this column touch the top, bring down this column so I can make words later, or clear out some blank tile—players' moves always have importance to them."
