Hi, my name is Hilton and maybe, just maybe, I am a text editor addict.

"Hello Hilton" you all say.

I seem to have a lot of text manipulation tools on my devices. Of course, I don’t think I have too many, but most people only seem to have one. You see, to me, each one has it’s own use, *it’s the best tool for it’s job*, that’s why I have and use it. Here is a list of all the text editors on my laptop that I use right now, and why:

- [BBEdit](http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.html): BBEdit is my hammer tool, when nothing else will work, it does. I open any new text file that I need to look at or perform searches in in BBEdit. I use it for macro and manual manipulation of all files. In fact, it's my default for opening any text file.
- [TextMate 2](http://blog.macromates.com/2011/textmate-2-0-alpha/): My old favorite programmer's editor, TextMate, just got better. TextMate is the editor I *used* to do all my Ruby on Rails work. Watching the development of TextMate 2 like a hawk because I still believe this will be the “it” programmer’s editor like its predecessor.
- [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com): My new go-to programmer's editor for Rails and scripts. Like the cross platform implementation, speed, active development and customizability, but still not comfortable with the GUI and the non-Mac likeness.
- [Byword](http://bywordapp.com): My go-to for writing, not coding. I draft and review all my blog posts in it (using the [Cousine](http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Cousine) font to make it look somewhat like iA Writer) and preview in [Marked](http://markedapp.com). I also write most knowledge base articles, company news and short-form documents in Byword.
- [Coda 2](https://panic.com/coda/): I use Coda 2 for static web site development to help out my favorite graphic designer.
- [iA Writer](http://www.iawriter.com): iA Writer sure is pretty, and I occasionally use it instead of Byword in full screen when I do not wish to be distracted. I just wish I could make it’s awesome Nitti Light font a tad smaller. And the blue cursor is cool!
- [nvAlt](http://brettterpstra.com/project/nvalt/): The way notes should be managed. I use nvAlt for all my common, non-project related text notes and sync it via [DropBox](http://www.dropbox.com) so I can work on the same documents on my iPad.
- [VoodooPad](http://flyingmeat.com/voodoopad/): Project notes wiki, see my post on [Project Specific Data](http://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/05/27/project-specific-data/).
- [Scrivener](http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php): I use Scrivener for all long form document generation. It’s a great writing and document management experience. This product just plain rocks!
- [TextEdit](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT2523): Ok, so it came with my Mac and it's still installed, and occasionally it’s useful to see what’s in a file.

Not really text-editors, but I write or format text using them:

- [Day One](http://dayoneapp.com): Personal journaling and logging, with the occasional private navel gazing entries to remind myself how silly I can be.
- [Pages](http://www.apple.com/iwork/pages/): Word processing, mostly used to format documents after conversion from Markdown to make others happy.
- [Microsoft Word](http://www.microsoft.com/mac/products): To read the changes in contracts from lawyers, else I'd not have it. It’s slow, bloated and ugly.
- [Adobe InDesign](http://www.adobe.com/products/indesign.html): Page layout for brochures and some special presentations. There are still things that you can do in InDesign for presentations that you cannot in others, but the latest [Keynote](http://www.apple.com/iwork/keynote/) is good enough these days.
- [OmniOutliner Pro](http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnioutliner/): For outlines and lists (but I’m using [Mindnode Pro](http://mindnode.com) for graphical versions and to start outlines which I then flesh out in OmniOutliner).

And I have purchased (if not free), but no longer use

- [TaskPaper](http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/taskpaper): Used to manage project specific tasks in it, replaced by VoodooPad.
- [Evernote](http://evernote.com): Keep coming back to try it, still do not love it or have a place for it.
- [MultiMarkdown Composer](http://multimarkdown.com): Lovely Markdown editing and preview tool, really the reference application, but a tad rustic for my needs. It’s still installed though, just in case.
- [Espresso](http://macrabbit.com/espresso/): Used to be my static web site tool, moved to Coda 2.
- [Writeroom](http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/writeroom/): The original distraction-free editor, now replaced with Byword and iA Writer.
- [MarsEdit](http://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/): One of my oldest tools, used to do all my blogging against Blogger and Wordpress in it. Now using [Octopress](http://octopress.org) and Byword, so no longer need it
- [Yojimbo](http://www.barebones.com/products/yojimbo/): Text notes containing all my secret and personal data, nicely packaged, tagged and encrypted. Mostly moved to [1Password](https://agilebits.com/onepassword) for codes, serial numbers and other key numbers.

And I am testing:

- [Chocolat](http://chocolatapp.com): Maybe a TextMate replacement, but not ready yet.
- [FoldingText](http://www.foldingtext.com): This looks just plain cool, still in beta.

*And that's just on my Mac.*

On the iPad or iPhone, I seem to have a few more, and they have their purposes too:

- [Drafts](http://agiletortoise.com/drafts): For quick notes and sharing with other applications.
- [Elements](http://www.secondgearsoftware.com/elements/): For most of my tablet writing, linked to Dropbox and shared with nvAlt, so I can start and finish notes on both devices.
- [TextTastic](http://www.textasticapp.com): For iPad coding, usually used for demo work only.
- [Diet Coda](https://panic.com/coda/): To hack static web sites in emergency situations.
- [Writing Kit](http://getwritingkit.com): For blog ideas, may be making this my new blog idea tool instead of nvAlt.
- [Byword](http://bywordapp.com): Alternative editor for nvAlt notes and remote blog editing.
- [Day One](http://dayoneapp.com): For journaling.
- [iA Writer](http://www.iawriter.com): Just in case I need another DropBox editor.
- [OmniOutliner](http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnioutliner/): Of course!
- [Pages](http://www.apple.com/iwork/pages/): This too.
- [Notability](http://www.gingerlabs.com/cont/notability.php) (removed)
- [PlainText](http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/products/plaintext) (removed)
- [SimpleNote](http://simplenoteapp.com) (removed)
- [Evernote](http://evernote.com) (removed)

So, no, I really don't have a text editor problem! Because the ones that remain installed each have a specific use case and are the *best tool* for these cases.

Or maybe, just maybe, I am a text editor addict.
