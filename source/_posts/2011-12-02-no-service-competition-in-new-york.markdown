Just a quick check on my choices for 21st century data services available at my apartment in New York city:

## Internet, Landline, Television

* Time Warner Cable
* <strike>Verizon FIOS</strike>

Oops, only TWC from today based on the agreement reached where Verizon quit the land-based business (See Susan Crawford's article: [Smug and chagrined](http://networkedblogs.com/qWwzk)). So no choice.

## Mobile Phone

* AT&T
* Verizon
* <strike>T-Mobile</strike> (still a dead spot after 8 years)
* <strike>Sprint</strike> (same as T-Mobile)

Neither work well, so I have to stick with AT&T because at least they have a MicroCell.  Until the iPhone 4S came out on Verizon, their phones were no good for overseas anyway. Average 1 *not*-dropped call a day.

Sounds like I have a choice between one expensive carrier or another that both offer terrible service.  So no choice.

I guess this is how the free market 'works'?
