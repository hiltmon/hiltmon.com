Looks like [Jeff Atwood](http://blog.codinghorror.com/standard-flavored-markdown/) ([@CodingHorror](http://twitter.com/codinghorror)), [John MacFarlane](http://johnmacfarlane.net), David Greenspan of [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com), and folks from StackExchange, Github and Reddit have put their money where their mouths are and released the first version of [Standard Markdown](http://standardmarkdown.com) at [http://standardmarkdown.com](http://standardmarkdown.com). 

I believe this *will* be the future of [John Gruber's](http://daringfireball.net) ([@daringfireball](https://twitter.com/daringfireball)) [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).

Up until now, I have relied  on [Fletcher Penney's](http://fletcherpenney.net) ([@multimarkdown](https://twitter.com/multimarkdown)) [MultiMarkdown](http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/) on the desktop for all my documents because of its consistency, ubiquity and wonderful extensions for writers (including tables and footnotes). I use [rdiscount](http://dafoster.net/projects/rdiscount/) for this blog for the same reason (especially it's speed).

I look forward to seeing [Standard Markdown](http://standardmarkdown.com) being integrated into these tools to remove inconsistencies, but rely too heavily on the extensions that are missing from [Standard Markdown](http://standardmarkdown.com) to consider a switch just yet.

I will, however, be watching the development of this very closely.

### Update Sep 4th, 2014

It seems John Gruber, the creator of Markdown, was not in the loop on [this]([https://twitter.com/gruber/status/507382610902126592]): 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/patrickrhone">@patrickrhone</a> Like two weeks ago, I got one email. I was on vacation then; hadnâ€™t yet responded.</p>&mdash; John Gruber (@gruber) <a href="https://twitter.com/gruber/status/507382610902126592">September 4, 2014</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

**Not cool.**

Knowing this now, I'll wait to see if and how he responds first.
