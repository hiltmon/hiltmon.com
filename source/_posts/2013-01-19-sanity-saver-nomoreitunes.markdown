*Sanity Savers are quick tips that help you stay sane when using your computer.*

I really don’t like it when you web browse to the App Store (iOS or Mac), it also launches iTunes or the App Store App on top. If I want to buy the app, I’ll click myself, I do not want my browsing flow to be interrupted by the launch of another application.

The [NoMoreiTunes Safari Extension](http://nomoreitunes.einserver.de) prevents this from happening. You can browse to and look at an app on the web and keep browsing without having new windows getting in the way. Just download and double-click the downloaded file to install it.

I also advise you to open Safari **Preferences**, go to the **Extensions** Tab, click on **Updates** and ensure that “Install Updates Automatically” is checked.
