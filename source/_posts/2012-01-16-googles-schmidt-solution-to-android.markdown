Following on to my earlier post on [How Google Failed to Fix the Mobile Market](https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/01/16/how-google-failed-to-fix-the-mobile-market/), Jamie Lendino writes in [Hey, Google: Here's What Fragmentation Means](http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2398783,00.asp) in PCMag:

{% blockquote %}
Schmidt's solution—that "if you don't like it, you can buy the phone from someone else"—doesn't work when you're locked in a two-year contract, when there are over 300,000 apps in Android Market to test, and when a phone vendor goes back on its promise to provide an OS upgrade. How could you possibly know beforehand what's going to happen?
{% endblockquote %}

Um, actually, if you buy an Android phone from a US carrier, you *will* get crapware, bloatware, a horrible custom interface, unremovable carrier apps and no upgrades on an ancient version of Android. Now you know.
