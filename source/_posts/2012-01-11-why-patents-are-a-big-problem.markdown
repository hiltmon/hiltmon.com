Brad Lindenberg nails it in [Why patents are a big f******* problem](http://www.lindventures.com/blog/2012/01/11/why-patents-are-a-big-fucking-problem/)

{% blockquote %}
There has to be a correlation between ideas and execution otherwise those who can execute get shafted by those who cannot.
{% endblockquote %}

I don't have a problem with patenting a physical thing that you make, I do have a problem patenting an idea, concept or discovery.
