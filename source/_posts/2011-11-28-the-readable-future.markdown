Brent Simmons nails it again in [The Readable Future](http://inessential.com/2011/11/25/the_readable_future), talking about the tools we all use to bypass all the ads and clutter of publisher's sites.

{% blockquote %}
The future is, one way or another, *readable*.

Because thatâ€™s what readers want, and because the technology is easier to find and use and learn than ever. That trend will continue because developers live to give people technologies that make life better.
{% endblockquote %}
