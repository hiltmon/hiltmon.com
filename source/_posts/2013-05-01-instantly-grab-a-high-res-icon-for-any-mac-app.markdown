In [Instantly grab a high-res icon for any iOS app](http://brettterpstra.com/2013/04/28/instantly-grab-a-high-res-icon-for-any-ios-app/), the awesome Brett Terpstra ([@ttscoff](http://twitter.com/ttscoff)) offered a script and an app to get the icon from iTunes for any **iOS** app.

I wanted the same for **Mac** apps. Turns out, it's a one word change to Brett's scripts. Just follow his instructions using the below files, but replace the script name with `macicon.rb` and the application name with `MacIcon`.

* [Download and save the script](https://gist.github.com/hiltmon/5496034) as `macicon.rb`.
* [Download the MacIcon Application]({{ root_url }}/Files/MacIcon.zip).

**Usual disclaimer: It works for me, should work for you, and no bunnies were harmed.**
