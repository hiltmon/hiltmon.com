It's been two months since I consolidated all my sites into this blog and started writing more. This blog just has a great February and I thought I'd share some stats.

## Views and Expansion

Great stats for February: **22,080** visitors to Hiltmon.com.

However, very very few read an additional article over the one they were looking for. I guess they found what they were looking for and moved on. Good to see the number of repeat visitors growing, but again it seems this is more people coming back to re-read the same article, not browse for more content.

Retweets do create minor spikes, but most retweets did not attribute the article to me or tag my twitter id [@hiltmon](https://twitter.com/hiltmon). I used an article title search on Twitter to find these retweets. I only gained 10 new twitter followers this month.

Facebook and Google+ added no new viewers.

## Top Pages

My top articles were:

* [The Markdown Mindset](http://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/02/20/the-markdown-mindset/) - 22,837 views
* [The Paradox of Choice](http://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/02/01/the-paradox-of-choice/) - 3,396 views
* [It Should Only Take You a Few Hours...](http://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/01/11/it-should-only-take-you-a-few-hours-dot-dot-dot/) - 629 views (6,322 last month)

Most of these views came via referrals from [reddit programming](http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/) or [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com/news). It was so exciting to watch the simultaneous viewer counts rise using Google Analytics live beta. Also pleasing to see that [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) and [Dreamhost](http://dreamhost.com/) gave no problems and remained very responsive to viewers.

But much as I like the volume, I don't seem to be growing a brand out of these referrals. Then again, I'm still trying to figure out what my brand should be.
