In preparation for the massive PR campaign *that will never happen*, I created a demo video of [TimeToCall]({{ root_url }}/timetocall/), showing off the new "drag down slider", and added it to the product page. *I am hoping v1.0.1 gets approved soon so you can all play with time.*

### Why make a Video?

* There is no trial on the App Store, so the next best thing is a quick video to help people decide whether the App does what they want. A lot more purchase decisions are made if the potential customer can see a video before they buy. The purchase seems less risky to them and they know what they are getting in to.
* The press gets so many emails that they too have no time to read all the text written about a product. But they do have a few minutes to watch a quick video, and that helps them decide whether to keep watching and write about the product.
* Users, unsure on how to use the app, get a quick-reference on how best to use it from the demo.
* Videos are cool.

To make this video, I ran [TimeToCall]({{ root_url }}/timetocall/) in the iOS Simulator and used [ScreenFlow 4](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/screenflow-4/id573279886?mt=12&uo=4&at=10l894) to record the screen, record my voice-over, present my finger as a white button, add the text annotations and edit the clips. *This is an amazing product, so easy to use*. I also used [GarageBand](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/garageband/id408980954?mt=12&uo=4&at=10l894) to create the Jazz soundtrack, using the default Apple Loops because I am not a musician. [ScreenFlow](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/screenflow-4/id573279886?mt=12&uo=4&at=10l894)  then handled the upload to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84EvUGKoTyQ).

I'd love to hear what you think of my demo video.

[TimeToCall]({{ root_url }}/timetocall/) is available on the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/timetocall/id596429979?ls=1&mt=8) for just 99c (USA). *Buying it supports this site.*
