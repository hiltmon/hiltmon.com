On Nov 22, 2012, the revamped [hiltmon.com](http://hiltmon.com) turned one year old. And I missed it as I was too busy guzzling turkey.

*Thank you all for reading, sharing and responding to my writing.*

### Stats from the First Year

* **287** posts.
* **67,536** pageviews.
* Taking the HN/Reddit outliers out, [hiltmon.com](http://hiltmon.com) is averaging **4,278** page views per month.
* Over the year, **41.66%** of visitors used Chrome, **20.82%** used Firefox and **20.07%** used Safari. But over the last 6 months, this has changed to **36.31%** Chrome, **34.62%** Safari and **13.97%** Firefox, tracking the demise of Firefox.
* Over the year, **36.66%** of visitors were on Windows, **33.27%** Macintosh and **11.55%** on Linux. Over the past 6 months, this has changed to **44.94%** Macintosh, **28.37%** Windows, **16.15%** iOS and **7.12%** Linux tracking the tone and content of this site.
* Only **18.17%** of page views are from mobile devices and this rate is growing rapidly. **84.2%** of mobile access is from iOS devices and the remainder seem to be Android variants.
* **57.1%** of page views source from from Google searches, **21.9%** direct and **5.2%** from Twitter and Facebook.
* **$0** spent on advertising and marketing. My plan was to focus on writing only this year and see how it went.
