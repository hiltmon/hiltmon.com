*TL;DR: You can use [ChronoSync][cs1] to access a remote [ChronoAgent][ca1] if [Back to My Mac][btmm] is turned on for both computers. Which means you can sync from anywhere!*

I have been using the excellent [ChronoSync][cs1] for years to ensure that the *Documents* and *Projects* folders on my personal laptop are kept in sync, and therefore backed up, with my home OS X server.

These days I have two laptops, the personal one that lives at home and is used for [Noverse](http://www.noverse.com) work, and the work one for my day job at the fund. But sometimes when a Noverse Client calls, I'm at the office and do not have access to my personal laptop which contains *their* software and files.

When this happens, I use *Back to My Mac* to access my home server, download their files, do the work, and then manually upload them back <span class="light">(see below how to do this, it's pretty easy)</span>.

But it takes time, time away from real work to do this upload and download every time. It would be better for them -- and me -- if my Noverse files were also kept in sync on my work laptop. And it would be even better if I could do this when not at home.

So a few days ago, I brought the work laptop home and set up ChronoSync on my work laptop. The plan was to sync at home in the evenings and if any Noverse work needed to be done, I'd have *close-to-the-latest* files to work with.

I started to enable the sync of *Documents* and *Projects* folder on the server to a Noverse sub-folder ... and stumbled across an interesting feature. Since I use [ChronoAgent][ca1] on my server to speed up syncs, it turns out that the work laptop "saw" the server ChronoAgent both on the LAN *and* on Back to My Mac. Which means it can sync from *anywhere*!

How cool is this.

Here is how to set it up. 

**Note: You do need ChronoAgent set up on the destination computer for this to work!**.

In ChronoSync, go to **Preferences** and choose the **Connections** tab. While on the home LAN, click **Add**:

As you can see, there are two references for `Kepler` (the name of my home server):

* `ChronoAgent@Kepler`, the usual LAN ChronoAgent, and 
* Another `ChronoAgent@Kepler` with `XXXXXXX.members.btmm.icloud.com` as its domain. That's the *Back to My Mac* one. I set this up as a new connection called  `KeplerRemote`.

Then in the sync documents, I simply used the new `KeplerRemote` agent connection instead of the regular `Kepler` agent connection:

Now I can sit at the office, or in a coffee shop, and use ChronoSync to sync files between my work or home laptop and the home server via *Back to My Mac*! No more wasting time downloading and uploading when a client calls! 

**Top Tip**: Use ChronoSync's built-in scheduler to schedule these syncs regularly and you can forget about worrying whether you have the latest files again.

### Aside: Finding your Back to my Mac ID

In order to use this, you will need a home Mac that remains turned on with:

{% img right /images/back-to-my-mac.jpg 193 93 %}

* *Back to My Mac* enabled on the home computer. Make sure **System Preferences** / **iCloud** has **Back to My Mac** checked and that there are no warnings.
* *Both* computers (home and laptop) are signed in to the same iCloud account.
* You also need *Back to My Mac* enabled on the laptop.

ChronoSync automatically finds the *Back to My Mac* address for you.  But if you just want to `ssh` in or mount your shared folder remotely, you will need your unique iCloud URL. To find out what your unique address is, open up the `Terminal.app` and type

	$ dns-sd -E

You should get something like this:

	DATE: ---Thu 15 Aug 2013---
	23:22:04.315  ...STARTING...
	Timestamp     Recommended Registration domain
	23:22:04.315  Added     (More)               local
	23:22:04.316  Added                          icloud.com
	                                             - > btmm
													- - > members
													- - - > XXXXXXXXX


Where `XXXXXXXX` is your unique ID.

Your home computer name is then:

	<computer name>.XXXXXXXXX.members.btmm.icloud.com

To mount a drive, launch `Finder` and press `âŒ˜K` to bring up the **Connect to Server** dialog and type in your computer's URL. *Note that you must have **File Sharing** checked in **System Preferences** / **Sharing** on the remote computer for this to work.*

{% img /images/connect-to-server.jpg 496 238 %}

Click **Connect** to see your shares at home.

For `ssh`, make sure the home computer has **Remote Login** enabled and the command is:

	# ssh user@<computer name>.XXXXXXXXX.members.btmm.icloud.com

Happy remoting.
