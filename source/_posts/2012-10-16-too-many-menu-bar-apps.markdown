These days, in order to maximize my productivity, I seem to be running a lot of menu bar apps on my Macintosh OS X system. So many that I had to buy a menu bar manager, [Bartender](http://www.macbartender.com)! *Add what you use in the comments.*

{% img /images/menu-bar-all.jpg 655 49 %}

Here’s what each one is and why I use it (in no particular order):

{% img left /images/menu-bar-1password.jpg %} **1Password** - One of my *must have* tools, enables me to reach and log into sites securely using strong site-specific passwords. Without it, I have no access to anything [https://agilebits.com/onepassword](https://agilebits.com/onepassword)

{% img left /images/menu-bar-alfred.jpg %}  **Alfred** - Quick launch applications and files, starting to use the saved clipboard too. Replaced Quicksilver, alternative to LaunchBar. [http://www.alfredapp.com](http://www.alfredapp.com).

{% img left /images/menu-bar-chronosync.jpg %}  **ChronoSync** - Automatic synchronization with my desktop when it awakes, and automatic backup to my USB drives when they plug in. Just works. [http://www.econtechnologies.com/pages/cs/chrono_overview.html](http://www.econtechnologies.com/pages/cs/chrono_overview.html)

{% img left /images/menu-bar-committed.jpg %}  **Committed** - New app that notifies whenever any of my Github repositories gets updated. [http://www.secondgearsoftware.com/committed/](http://www.secondgearsoftware.com/committed/)

{% img left /images/menu-bar-dayone.jpg %}  **DayOne** - The very best journalling application, containing what I did every day, and auto-loaded  with my tweets, posts and instagrams using [Slogger](http://ttscoff.github.com/Slogger/). [http://dayoneapp.com](http://dayoneapp.com)

{% img left /images/menu-bar-dropbox.jpg %}  **Dropbox** - All my current notes, settings and key files synced across all devices, nice and safely. [https://www.dropbox.com](https://www.dropbox.com)

{% img left /images/menu-bar-growl.jpg %}  **Growl** - Still using growl for old application and scripted notifications, redirecting to notification center in Mountain Lion. [http://growl.info](http://growl.info)

{% img left /images/menu-bar-hazel.jpg %}  **Hazel** - Automatically cleans up and moves my files around, leaving me to worry about other things. [http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel.php](http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel.php)

{% img left /images/menu-bar-keyboard-maestro.jpg %}  **Keyboard Maestro** - The indispensable productivity tool for mapping keystrokes to actions, making markdown links, opening and closing applications for different work scenarios and saving me time. [http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/](http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/)

{% img left /images/menu-bar-moom.jpg %}  **Moom** - Moves and resizes windows, set up with keystrokes to place my application windows where I want them spatially. [http://manytricks.com/moom/](http://manytricks.com/moom/)

{% img left /images/menu-bar-postgres.jpg %}  **Postgres** - Runs my development PostgreSQL database server in the background without having to go through the pain of installing it. [http://postgresapp.com](http://postgresapp.com)

{% img left /images/menu-bar-textexpander.jpg %}  **TextExpander** - My other *must have* tool to save me keystrokes on things I type a lot, like paths, file names, special characters and mail messages. [http://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/index.html](http://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/index.html)

{% img left /images/menu-bar-trickster.jpg %}  **Trickster** - Quick access via keystroke to my most recently used and downloaded files and applications. [http://www.apparentsoft.com/trickster](http://www.apparentsoft.com/trickster)

{% img left /images/menu-bar-apple-sync.jpg %}  **Apple Sync** - Seems to keep coming back, currently syncing my Google contacts, I think.

{% img left /images/menu-bar-istat-temp.jpg %}  **iStat Menus - CPU Temp** - The current CPU temperature, usually hidden unless I’m running a lot of compiles or data analyses, then it gets back on top. [http://bjango.com/mac/istatmenus/](http://bjango.com/mac/istatmenus/)

{% img left /images/menu-bar-istat-memory.jpg %}  **iStat Menus - Memory** - How much RAM is being used right now, usually hidden, but I move it to the top when running VM’s.

{% img left /images/menu-bar-apple-volume.jpg %}  **Apple Volume** - The OS X Volume Slider, occasionally used to switch volume output with the ⌥ key.

{% img left /images/menu-bar-billings.jpg %}  **Billings** - Always running when I am working, Billings tracks my time on client projects, so it makes the top. [http://www.marketcircle.com/billings/](http://www.marketcircle.com/billings/)

{% img left /images/menu-bar-fantastical.jpg %}  **Fantastical** - Quick access to my calendars and quick creation of new appointments, I seem to open this many times a day, hence it’s on the top bar. [http://flexibits.com](http://flexibits.com)

{% img left /images/menu-bar-bartender.jpg %}  **Bartender** - The magical little utility that moves all the excess menu bar app icons onto its own bar, so I don’t see them all the time. [http://www.macbartender.com](http://www.macbartender.com)

{% img left /images/menu-bar-apple-wifi.jpg %}  **Apple WiFi** - I often switch from home to client to coffee shop, WiFi shows me when I am connected.

{% img left /images/menu-bar-istat-network.jpg %}  **iStat Menus - Network** - I like to see how much bandwidth is being used. Often, a glance at this explains why things are slow. [http://bjango.com/mac/istatmenus/](http://bjango.com/mac/istatmenus/)

{% img left /images/menu-bar-istat-cpus.jpg %}  **iStat Menus - CPUs** - Displays how busy each CPU is on my system, gives quick access to running apps (quiet while capturing the image).

{% img left /images/menu-bar-apple-timemachine.jpg %}  **Apple Time Machine** - Shows when last the time machine backup ran and when it is running, reminds me to keep an eye on it.

But that’s not all, there are a number of applications that I run when needed (or run headless) that also add icons to the menu bar, including:

*  **Backblaze** - Backups to the internet with style and ease, usually hidden as it’s on all the time. [http://www.backblaze.com](http://www.backblaze.com)
* **Caffeine** - Keeps the screen from going to sleep, often used when presenting. [http://lightheadsw.com/caffeine/](http://lightheadsw.com/caffeine/)
* **Sticky Notifications** - To leave a note to myself when I take breaks. [http://instinctivecode.com/sticky-notifications/](http://instinctivecode.com/sticky-notifications/)
* **Tweetbot** - Gotta see what’s happening, but only when I am not working. [http://tapbots.com/software/tweetbot/](http://tapbots.com/software/tweetbot/)
* **Skype** - Talking to family, friends and colleagues. [http://www.skype.com/](http://www.skype.com/)
* **Skitch** - Taking screen snaps (old). [http://skitch.com](http://skitch.com)
* **LittleSnapper** - Taking screen snaps (new). [http://www.realmacsoftware.com/littlesnapper/](http://www.realmacsoftware.com/littlesnapper/)
* **Apple Messages** - Always running, connected to Google Talk and Facebook Chat, but hidden from view so it does not distract me. [http://www.apple.com/osx/apps/#messages](http://www.apple.com/osx/apps/#messages)
* **nvAlt** - I ran this for a while as a menu bar app, but prefer it in the dock these days. For notes and drafts. [http://brettterpstra.com/project/nvalt/](http://brettterpstra.com/project/nvalt/)
* **PasteBot Sync** - Turned on when I need to copy and paste from my iOS devices.  [http://tapbots.com/software/pastebot/](http://tapbots.com/software/pastebot/)
* **xScope** - Can anyone do any design without it? Really? [http://iconfactory.com/software/xscope](http://iconfactory.com/software/xscope)
* **VMWare Fusion** - When the VM’s are running so I can see the start menus. [http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/overview.html](http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/overview.html)

Most of these menu bar apps spend their days hidden by Bartender because there are too many of them and most are accessible using keystrokes. *All* save me time and effort day in and day out.

*What do you use and find indispensable on your menu bar? I’d love to know and try them out.*

*FYI: The cog at the end of the bottom bar is the Bartender preferences icon.*
