A brilliant essay by Danielle Fong called [Trade Trade Secrets](http://einfall.wordpress.com/2012/01/23/trade-trade-secrets/), very worth a read, covers everything from Intellectual Property, to explaining the differences between theft, transcription, transformation and inspiration, to how the law stifles all four of them.

{% blockquote %}
The great danger of laws that ignore these is not that they will prevent theft, but that they will so heavyhandedly prevent transformation and inspiration: the engines of our entire civilization.
{% endblockquote %}

Just read it.
