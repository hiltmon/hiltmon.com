{% blockquote John Scalzi http://whatever.scalzi.com/2014/08/09/amazon-gets-increasingly-nervous/ %}
In sum and once again: Amazon is not your friend. Neither is any other corporation. It and they do what they do for their own interest and are more than willing to try to make you try believe that what they do for their own benefit is in fact for yours.
{% endblockquote %}

Replace **Amazon** with any company name of your choice and this remains 100% true.
