The sub-theme this week is on trying to find ways to improve developer happiness and to reduce unpleasant time wasters.

Rafe Colburn in [Don’t order your team to work more hours](http://rc3.org/2012/01/17/dont-order-your-team-to-work-more-hours/) talks about bosses who ask staff to work more hours:

{% blockquote %}
Every time you’re tempted to do so, sit down with members of the team and ask them how many hours a week they spend dealing with stuff not related to shipping and work to make those things go away instead.
{% endblockquote %}

David Heinemeier Hansson gets specific in [Refusing administrative minutiae](http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3081-refusing-administrative-minutiae), picking on expense reports.

{% blockquote %}
Optimizing your business for happiness is about a lot of things, but taking out all the needless administrative minutiae seems like one of the easiest. Why aren’t you?
{% endblockquote %}

Pass these on to your boss.
