One of the nicest things I have ever seen for one of the nicest guys on our corner of the internet. It's [Brett Terpstra's](http://brettterpstra.com) birthday today and all his friends have taken the time to celebrate him and his works, including:

* David Sparks at MacSparky: [International Terpstra Day](http://www.macsparky.com/blog/2012/7/19/international-terpstra-day.html)
* Gabe at Macdrifter: [Terpstra Day](http://www.macdrifter.com/2012/07/terpstra-day/)
* Frederico Viticci at Macstories: [Terpstra Day](http://www.macstories.net/links/terpstra-day/)
* Dr Drang at LeanCrew: [Brett Terpstra day](http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/2012/07/brett-terpstra-day/)
* Michael Schechter at A Better Mess: [Celebrate Terpstra Day](http://bettermess.com/celebrate-terpstra-day/)
* Eddie Smith at Practically Efficient: [Terpstra Day](http://www.practicallyefficient.com/2012/07/19/terpstra/)

For the few of you who do not know of him, Brett is the developer of [Marked.app](http://markedapp.com) that I use every day for preview and export of markdown files, he's the developer of [nvAlt](http://brettterpstra.com/project/nvalt/) which I recommend for all your notes, he writes as part of [Read & Trust](http://readandtrust.com), has a new Podcast called [Systematic](http://5by5.tv/systematic), and he gives away huge numbers of [free tools and scripts](http://brettterpstra.com/code/). 

*His work inspires me to be better at what I do.*

So buy his stuff, follow him on Twitter at [@ttscoff](http://twitter.com/ttscoff) or just donate from his [home page](http://brettterpstra.com).

*It's the mark of a true good person that their friends take the time and effort to celebrate them, and an even greater mark that people he's never met feel the same way.*
