[Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org) is a project I have been observing for a while now, an attempt to create a new, fast, safe, systems programming language to replace C++, but with better memory safety and a bullet-proof concurrency model. Last week, [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org) hit 1.0, and I think I may start testing it out for highly threaded, small and fast calculation tools that I would normally write and fight in C++. *If any of you are using it, please let me know what for in the comments.*

And before anyone points me at Google's excellent [Go](https://golang.org) language, I am already looking into it to speed up, parallelize and replace a ton of Ruby and Python code on the server side.
