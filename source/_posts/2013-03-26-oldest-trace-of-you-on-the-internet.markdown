For a lark, and in response to this tweet:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>what's the oldest trace of yourself you can find on the internet?</p>&mdash; Kyle McDonald (@kcimc) <a href="https://twitter.com/kcimc/status/315851225339949056">March 24, 2013</a></blockquote>

I started on the Internet in the late 1980's when it was still called Arpanet. I connected our University of Cape Town UNIX boxes via [UUCP][wikipedia] to Rhodes University in South Africa which in turn used UUCP to talk to Oxford University in the UK, which in turn connected to one of the Ivy Leagues in the USA. The first message I sent was on behalf of my Professor to [Donald Knuth][wikipedia 2], and we got a response. But all traces of that are gone.

I spent the early to mid 1990's in [Bulletin Boards][wikipedia 3], [CompuServe][wikipedia 4], browsing [Gopher][wikipedia 5] sites and in the Lotus forums. Then moved on to hosted Internet in the late 1990's. But all traces of that are gone. **Or are they?**

## Google 1998

The earliest trace that Google could find was in a 1998-05-26 press release reported in [The Age | Hard Drive][internetprovidersqld], an Australian Newspaper, <span class="light">highlighting is my own, skipped the bumf to see the reference</span>:

{% blockquote %}
BRACKIN SIGNS UP A CAST OF HUNDREDS

AAG Holdings chairman and Netbridge managing director Allan Brackin continues to boost his national team, now 250-plus, adding more aces to his Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney offices.

...

Project management specialists Jan Priest and <mark>Hilton Lipschitz</mark> join Melbourne and Sydney teams on a contract basis.

...
{% endblockquote %}

The search was performed using **"Hilton Lipschitz"** as the search string (quotes included), then clicking **Search Tools** on the results page and setting a custom range under **Any Time**. *I ignored any references where the page was created later, for example, old school photographs from the 1980's but published in the 2000's.*

## Lotus Forums 1995

When I dug deeper, I found these gem's in the Lotus forums which must have been loaded into Google Groups at some point, so in 1995:

application

Try ViP if you like BASIC and want to play notes and other databases. 
ODBC and Access only work when there is a unique index and there is no 
such thing in Notes.  Microsoft - so it is rumoured - is working on 
this.

## The Wayback Machine 1996

Which led me to [The Wayback Machine](http://archive.org/web/web.php) and [my home page](http://web.archive.org/web/19961226071414/http://www.ozemail.com.au/~hiltonl/index.html) circa 1996. I'd forgotten had done this one. Besides the horrible graphic work and default font, I love that:

{% img right /images/1996-seltex.jpg 350 501 %}

* The javascript hack to add a scrolling message on the browser status bar still works in 2013! [Check it out](http://web.archive.org/web/19961226071414/http://www.ozemail.com.au/~hiltonl/index.html)!
* I used a better software development methodology than waterfall back then (and documented it): [Software Development Methodology](http://web.archive.org/web/19961222092338/http://www.ozemail.com.au/~hiltonl/softdevm/index.htm)
* I published my first blog <span class="light">(?)</span> article, but had to spread it over many pages as Australian bandwidth was limited in those days: [Lotus Notes vs the Intranet (Private Internet)](http://web.archive.org/web/19961222092129/http://www.ozemail.com.au/~hiltonl/notevnet.htm). This page was was linked to from Lotus at the time.
* I had a lot of hits, 7216, over the life of that article. That was a lot for 1996!
{% img right  /images/1998-indaba-redirect.jpg 350 124 %}
* I was talking about coffee back then on the [Home Page](http://web.archive.org/web/19961226071414/http://www.ozemail.com.au/~hiltonl/index.html). Does that make the the earliest tech coffee nerd?

The site was taken down in May 1998 when I migrated to the Indaba Solutions domain.

I guess anything you do *does* remain on the Internet somewhere.  **What's the oldest *real* trace of you on the Internet?**
