I have removed TimeToCall from the App Store effective today, for several reasons:

1. I did not update it for iOS 7 (or iOS 8) and it's starting to look shabby.
2. I never made any worthwhile money from it or received blog pageviews from it.
3. There are newer and better products out there.
4. I do not want to clutter the App Store with yet another abandoned product.
5. It no longer showcases my development capabilities, they are far better now.

To those of you who purchased and used the product, thank you.
