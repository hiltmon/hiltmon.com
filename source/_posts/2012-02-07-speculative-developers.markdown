I totally agree with the sentiment in David Sparks's note [Speculative Developers](http://www.macsparky.com/blog/2012/2/6/speculative-developers.html) where he compares developers who 'barf' out volumes of bad apps versus developers who lovingly craft a single great app.

{% blockquote %}
They are, however, completely wrong. Their chance of hitting it big with two (or twenty) crappy apps instead of one good one is about the same as their chance of retiring with their lotto winnings. Infinitesimally small.

If you want to develop apps, take your time and make something awesome. Make it fast. Make it beautiful. Make something you’re proud of. Don’t make 60 crappy apps: Make one really good one.
{% endblockquote %}

I wholeheartedly am *not* a speculative developer, I prefer to make and buy lovingly crafted applications.
