First they came for the record stores<br/>and I didn't speak out<br/>because I used iTunes online.

Then they came for the bookstores<br/>and I didn't speak out<br/>because I used Kindle online.

Then they came for the grocery stores<br/>and I didn't speak out<br/>because I used FreshDirect online.

Then they came for the restaurants<br/>and I didn't speak out<br/>because I used SeamlessWeb online.

Then they came for the shoe stores<br/>and I didn't speak out<br/>because I used Zappos online.

Then they came for the home-wares stores<br/>and I didn't speak out<br/>because I used Soap online.

Then they came for the stationery stores<br/>and I didn't speak out<br/>because I used Staples online.

First they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out<br/>Because I was not a Socialist.

Then they came for the Trade Unionists, and I did not speak out<br/>Because I was not a Trade Unionist.

Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out<br/>Because I was not a Jew.

Then they came for me<br/>and there was no one left to speak for me.
