Following up on my recent [I just want a Hamburger](https://hiltmon.com/blog/2011/11/25/i-just-want-a-hamburger/) post, I came across a wonderful article by Jared Spool entitled [Do users change their settings?](http://www.uie.com/brainsparks/2011/09/14/do-users-change-their-settings/).

In line with that I said about developers thoughtfully making decisions on options for their users, Jared makes some beautiful points

{% blockquote %}
Less than 5% of the users we surveyed had changed any settings at all.
{% endblockquote %}

Why?

{% blockquote %}
They assumed Microsoft had delivered it turned off for a reason, therefore who were they to set it otherwise. “Microsoft must know what they are doing,” several of the participants told us.
{% endblockquote %}

Is this true?

{% blockquote %}
The users’ assumption that Microsoft had given this careful consideration turned out not to be the case.
{% endblockquote %}

**It should be the case.**  As I wrote

{% blockquote %}
It is our duty as developers to make the best choices for our users, to select the most useful defaults and to offer only the most necessary options.
{% endblockquote %}
