If you use Twitter and click on `t.co` links, or use Google search and follow their links, chances are your browser history is a mess of `t.co/C*R@A%P&` or `google.com/S$H@I*T#`. Which means there is no way to use your browser history to find that page you just saw (or saw a few days ago) and accidentally closed. And autocomplete does not work either.

[Shaun Inman](http://www.shauninman.com/blog) (of [Mint](http://haveamint.com) and [The Last Rocket](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/the-last-rocket/id429747672?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l894) fame) created a Safari extension called [Detox](http://www.shauninman.com/archive/2012/01/19/detox) a while ago that automatically expands those pesky `t.co` links and funky Google links back into their original URLs and titles. Making your browser history and autocomplete useable again.

Download it from [here](http://www.shauninman.com/assets/downloads/Detox.safariextz) and double click the `Detox.safariextz` file to install it. And [fuggedaboudit](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/fuggedaboudit#English)!

Highly recommended for all OS X Safari users.

Thank you Shaun for a great Sanity Saver.
