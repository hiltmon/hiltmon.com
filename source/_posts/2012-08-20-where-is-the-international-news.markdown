Claire Belinski explains in the badly titled [How to Read Today's Unbelievably Bad News :: Gatestone Institute](http://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/3294/how-to-read-today-unbelievably-bad-news) where good international news coverage has gone.

In the event of a massive breaking story—such as the uprisings in Tahrir Square—the networks parachute their people in.

The answer, usually, is that the paper is trying to sell a particular version of local events to investors and to English-speakers—a version, needless to say, that is not necessarily the whole truth).
