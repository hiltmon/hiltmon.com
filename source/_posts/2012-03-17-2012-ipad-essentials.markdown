The new iPad arrived yesterday. Instead of restoring from a backup, I decided to build it clean and install only essential apps.  Here are the ones (*excluding games*) that made it in the first 24 hours, pretty much in order of addition:

* [iBooks](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ibooks/id364709193?mt=8) - I read a lot of ePub books on the iPad, and the new retina text rendering is so great.
* [Instapaper](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/instapaper/id288545208?mt=8) - Essential tool to save, search and read long form writing found on the net. Use it to archive all the cool articles I find.
* [TweetBot](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tweetbot-twitter-client-personality/id498801050?mt=8) - The best twitter client out there, even better than my old favorite [Twitterrific](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/twitterrific-for-twitter/id359914600?mt=8). Love the UI and the gap detection.
* [Reeder](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reeder/id375661689?mt=8) - Lovely RSS reader, for all my news and technology feeds.
* [FlipBoard](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/flipboard/id358801284?mt=8) - More news, from sources not followed in RSS.
* [Zite](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/zite/id419752338?mt=8&ls=1) - Even more reading material, should I run out of the above.
* [Skype](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/skype-for-ipad/id442012681?mt=8) - For those who do not use Facetime.
* [Facebook](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/facebook/id284882215?mt=8) - Cause I gotta share.
* [Keynote](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/keynote/id361285480?mt=8), [Numbers](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/numbers/id361304891?mt=8) and [Pages](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pages/id361309726?mt=8) - I have to iWork too. Most of my demos these days are on the iPad, and Keynote rocks.
* [iMovie](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/imovie/id377298193?mt=8), [iPhoto](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/iphoto/id497786065?ls=1&mt=8) and [Garageband](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/garageband/id408709785?mt=8) - So I can create, or play, or annoy.
* [OmniFocus](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/omnifocus-for-ipad/id383804552?mt=8) - to keep me on track and remind me what I need to get done, synched across all my iDevices.
* [DayOne](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/day-one-journal-diary/id421706526?mt=8) - to remember what I did.
* [Byword](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/byword/id482063361?mt=8) - to view and create notes, and write, replacing [Elements](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/elements-dropbox-markdown/id382752422?mt=8) for notes.
* [Penultimate](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/penultimate/id354098826?mt=8) - scribble notes, or draw diagrams to support my points, it's my scratchpad.
* [xScope Mirror](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xscope-mirror/id488819289?mt=8) - to see how things look from the Mac.
* [TextExpander](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/textexpander/id326180690?mt=8) - to share my expansions, especially for notes.
* [Prompt](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/prompt/id421507115?mt=8) - to get to servers when I need to, when Murphy's Law strikes.
* [Textastic](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/textastic-code-editor/id383577124?mt=8) - so I can edit code anywhere, this is my "Emergency: Break Glass" app after Prompt.
* [Yojimbo](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/yojimbo-for-ipad/id396307682?mt=8) - Key document and information backup.
* [1Password](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/1password-for-ipad/id364747489?mt=8) - Of course
* [Soulver](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/soulver-for-ipad/id371982536?mt=8) - A better calculation tool.

Of course, **Mail**, **FaceTime**, **iMessage** and **iTunes Match** were set up first.

Surprise dropouts (applications I though I would have loaded but did not):

* [Boxcar](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/boxcar/id321493542?mt=8) - Notifications when something happens out there - I don't need the interruptions any more.
* [Readability](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/readability/id460156587?mt=8) - I'm an InstaPaper man, I don't need another.
* [IMDB](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/imdb-movies-tv/id342792525?mt=8) - Never used it, seem to Google first, yet it has been on my iPad since the original.
* [OpenTable](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/opentable-for-ipad/id375864276?mt=8) - I find myself calling restaurants directly instead of online booking these days, saves them money and I am more likely to get a table.
* [MacGourmet](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/macgourmet-touch-for-ipad/id421025820?mt=8) - Never take the iPad into the kitchen, so I don't need the recipes. The missus just found out I had this. Oops.
* [StarWalk](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/star-walk-for-ipad-interactive/id363486802?mt=8) - I love this app, just never use it
