It used to be said that:

{% blockquote %}
If you pay for a product, you’re a customer. If you don’t, you’re the product.
{% endblockquote %}

Now its getting worse. The new [Instagram Terms of Use](http://instagram.com/about/legal/terms/updated/) make you the advertisement for any unknown third party product. **Anyone can pay Instagram to use *your* user name, *your* image, and *your* photos to advertise their product to anyone else, without your knowledge or consent.**

{% blockquote Instagram Terms of Use http://instagram.com/about/legal/terms/updated/ %}
2. Some or all of the Service may be supported by advertising revenue. To help us deliver interesting paid or sponsored content or promotions, you agree that a business or other entity may pay us to display your username, likeness, photos (along with any associated metadata), and/or actions you take, in connection with paid or sponsored content or promotions, without any compensation to you. If you are under the age of eighteen (18), or under any other applicable age of majority, you represent that at least one of your parents or legal guardians has also agreed to this provision (and the use of your name, likeness, username, and/or photos (along with any associated metadata)) on your behalf.
{% endblockquote %}

It seems there is no way to prevent this.

Facebook recently did the same thing, just more sneakily. They state you can use your privacy settings to *opt out* of having your name and profile picture used in anyone else's advertisement, but default the setting to *opted in*, of course. Go to [your privacy settings](https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=ads) on Facebook to disable.

{% blockquote Facebook Terms of Service http://www.facebook.com/legal/terms %}
1. You can use your privacy settings to limit how your name and profile picture may be associated with commercial, sponsored, or related content (such as a brand you like) served or enhanced by us. You give us permission to use your name and profile picture in connection with that content, subject to the limits you place.
{% endblockquote %}

Personally, I prefer to endorse products I like on my blog. I do not want nor permit **Facebook** or **Instagram** to use my name, likeness or any of my images to promote, endorse, advertise or sell products without my express permission (and I should get paid for it too).

I understand these companies need to find ways to make money. Abusing their user’s reputations is the wrong way to go.
