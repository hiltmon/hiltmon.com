I think I have finally figured out how I want to use [App.Net](http://alpha.app.net/hiltmon) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/hiltmon) . Given my low follower counts on both, and the different follower groups I have on each, I should get away with it.

*TL;DR: Follow me on both, no more cross-posting *anything* except blog post announcements, mute `#xpost` on one service to prevent duplicates. <span class="light">(Really? A TL;DR here! For an article this short? Where the "Too Long; Don't Read" is about the same length as the post. Yes Really!)</span>*

I intend to use Twitter [@hiltmon](http://twitter.com/hiltmon) as I do now, for notifying people of posts on this site as well as for personal updates, Instagrams, jokes, scotch and any responses to messages. *The persona on Twitter is this guy, me, with a tech blog, this.* Twitter presents my intellectual brilliance in 140 characters, and more often than not, pie-in-face moments.

On App.Net, I intend to use ADN [@hiltmon](http://alpha.app.net/hiltmon) for more meaningful discussions, more in-depth technical talk, more hop-on posts (which may annoy others already in that discussion) and leave the personal stuff and silly jokes aside. The only cross-posts will be blog announcements, in the hope that they start these more meaningful discussions.

> If you follow me on both (and you should), mute the `#xpost` hashtag on **one** of them, you'll get all the messages, but only once. No duplicates.

Either way, I plan to remain me, polite, courteous, curious, stubborn, socially awkward in a crowd, with a splash of humor and irreverence on both. It is who I am, I cannot be otherwise.

Oh, and if you follow me on [@NoverseLLC](http://twitter.com/noversellc) (my company Twitter account), switch to [@hiltmon](http://alpha.app.net/hiltmon). I rarely post on it any more and am considering replacing the company web with a static site and merging the blogs (which means you may see a few more business-like posts here).

So announcing the biggest change in [hiltmon.com](http://hiltmon.com) since, well, the last blog post. The new follow message at the bottom <span class="light">(Delta: `s/or/and/i` + "Mute `#xpost` on one.")</span>:

*Follow the author as [@hiltmon](http://twitter.com/hiltmon) on Twitter and [@hiltmon](http://alpha.app.net/hiltmon) on App.Net. Mute `#xpost` on one.*
