If you are looking for more proof that there is no real competition in the US mobile carrier space, check out BGRâ€™s [iPhone: Data caps, upgrade fees blamed on iPhone by AT&T, Verizon](http://www.bgr.com/2012/08/06/iphone-data-caps-upgrade-fees-att-verizon/) by Brad Reed:

{% blockquote %}
AT&T reported a 45% margin in Q2 2012 and Verizon reported a record-high 49% margin.
{% endblockquote %}

Challenge: Name one *competitive* industry with such high margins and such terrible service?
