After reading Federico Viticci's [Automating iOS: How Pythonista Changed My Workflow](http://www.macstories.net/stories/automating-ios-how-pythonista-changed-my-workflow/), I think its time I added the [Python](http://www.python.org) Programming Language to my repertoire.

The first thing I learned about [Python](http://www.python.org) is the [Zen of Python](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/) by Tim Peters:

- Beautiful is better than ugly.
- Explicit is better than implicit.
- Simple is better than complex.
- Complex is better than complicated.
- Flat is better than nested.
- Sparse is better than dense.
- Readability counts.
- Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
- Although practicality beats purity.
- Errors should never pass silently.
- Unless explicitly silenced.
- In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
- There should be one -- and preferably only one -- obvious way to do it.
- Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
- Now is better than never.
- Although never is often better than *right* now.
- If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
- If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
- Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

I think this really applies to all languages and programming in general.
