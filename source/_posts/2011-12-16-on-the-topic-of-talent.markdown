Jorge Quinteros, writing [on the Topic of Talent](http://folio.jorgeq.com/post/14221217462/on-the-topic-of-talent).

{% blockquote %}
Talent is the natural ability to do something for which people may think there’s not much effort put into accomplishing something and that’s simply a result of people not always being previewed to what you go through to do what you do.
{% endblockquote %}

I'm a very good software designer. Proof? I have a long track record of excellent software. Those who know me and my work invariably describe me as talented. Therefore, *ipso facto*, I must be a good software designer because I am talented. **Rubbish**! *Bunkum and tummyrot!*

I agree with Jorge.  This imaginary 'talent' thing comes from years and years of hard, painstaking work; from failures and picking yourself up again and again; from criticism and despair; and from occasional success.  You know you are getting better when you craft something great, only to fall down on the next endeavor. And it never ends, there is always more to learn, more to improve, more to perfect.

I am a very good software designer **because I have spent the last 21 years of my life learning, practicing and tuning my craft**. 

And I still have a long way to go.
