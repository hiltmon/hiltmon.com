Daniel Jalkut, writing on his Red-Sweater blog in [Target The Forward Fringe](http://www.red-sweater.com/blog/2568/target-the-forward-fringe) nails who our target market truly is, in discussing whether to retina-ize (HiDPI) our websites and applications.

{% blockquote %}
Because HiDPI customers may be a fringe group, but they are a forward-facing fringe. They represent the users of the future, and the more we cater to them now, the more deeply embedded our products and designs will be in their culture. The future culture.
{% endblockquote %}

Guess I need to update my art too, huh.
