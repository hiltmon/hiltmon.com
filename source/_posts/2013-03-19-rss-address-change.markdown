 <span class="light">Update: This post has been updated with a new feed URL that will become the standard in future releases of Octopress. If you re-subscribed, I'd ask if you could please do it one more time. Thanks.</span>

It looks like Google is about to kill off [Feedburner](http://feedburner.google.com), so its best if we get started on the transition. Going forward, I'll be using [Octopress'](http://octopress.org) built-in RSS feed. Please re-subscribe to **The Hiltmon RSS Feed** at:

<!-- [http://www.hiltmon.com/atom.xml](http://www.hiltmon.com/atom.xml) -->
[http://www.hiltmon.com/feed/](http://www.hiltmon.com/feed/)

New subscribers will get the new link when you subscribe from my toolbar or your browser bar.

The feed at Feedburner will continue to work for a while, then redirect you to the old one (it picks up the data directly from my feed anyway). And you can always get notified of new posts by following me at [Twitter]((http://twitter.com/hiltmon), [App.Net](http://alpha.app.net/hiltmon) or [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/hiltmoncom).

I know it's a pain to make this change, but re-subscribing means I have one less terminally ill Google service for us to rely on and you have one less channel where Google tracks you.

*Follow the author as [@hiltmon](http://twitter.com/hiltmon) on Twitter and [@hiltmon](http://alpha.app.net/hiltmon) on App.Net. Mute `#xpost` on one.*
