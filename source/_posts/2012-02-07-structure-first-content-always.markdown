Mark Boulton makes good points in [Structure First. Content Always.](http://www.markboulton.co.uk/journal/comments/structure-first-content-always)
 
{% blockquote %}
Let’s stop siloing content, shall we? We did it for a while when we were designing a largely brochureware, templated web. Now, we’re trying to move that silo from one end of the process to the other. Let’s focus on structure to begin with, and think about content all the time. There is a symbiotic relationship between content and design. One cannot thrive without the other.

Let’s start with structure. Let’s know what our content is made from. Not, necessarily, what it is.
{% endblockquote %}

Agreed.
