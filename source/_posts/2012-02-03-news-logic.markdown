Paddy Harrington, writing in [Wanna Figure Out If Your Product Is Any Good? Think Like A News Editor](http://www.fastcodesign.com/1668945/wanna-figure-out-if-your-work-is-any-good-think-like-a-news-editor)

{% blockquote %}
At its heart, news logic is about value creation and the primacy of the design output instead of a story that traditionally gets applied after the fact. Where in the old days (i.e., five years ago), you designed something and then told a story about it in the hopes that it was a story worth telling, more and more of tomorrowâ€™s design projects will have a story worth telling built into their hearts right from the get-go.
{% endblockquote %}

I try to apply this thinking here, only posting links to articles I think are great, or creating articles I think are newsworthy. If there are any topics you'd like me to expound upon, comment here or tweet me.
