I wrote a post in September 2011 in the [Noverse Blog](http://www.noverse.com/blog/) called [Get It Brilliant](http://www.noverse.com/blog/2011/09/get-it-brilliant/) on the what you really need to achieve to create amazing software products. They are:

* Get it **Designed**
* Get it **Architected**
* Get it **Working**
* Get it **Right**
* Get it **Fast**
* Get it **Intuitive**
* Get it **Out**

Looking back, it sure was not one of my finest writing efforts, but the concepts are important.

Since that article was written, I have worked on two products that you will see early next year. Both are properly designed and architected. Both are working, right, fast and intuitive. All that's left is to do is ship.

Its going to be a brilliant 2012.
