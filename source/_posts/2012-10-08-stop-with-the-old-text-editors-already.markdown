Over the past few years, it has become *a thing* to stop using IDE’s and modern text editors in favor of Vim. I understand older programmers using Vim out of habit, but the new generation of programmers? I don’t get it. Every-time I write about text editors, this growing group tweets to give modern GUI editors up and switch to old trusty rusty crusty terminal-based Vim. 

Stop it! I’m not going to do that.

My reasoning is not religious fervor or hatred. Folks, I’m a graybeard, I used `vi` on a real physical VT100 terminal in the late 1980’s and with emulators in the early 1990’s to do all my work. `vi` worked great when you had full-screen 80x25 terminals, no GUI or mouse, and petrol (gasoline) was leaded. If you remembered the shortcuts, you could be pretty productive in it. I know the product very well. That’s why I used it back then.

But `vi` on a VT100 was more than 22 years ago. Technology has changed.

We use GUI’s and mice and touch screens now and have for a long time. We’re no longer limited to 80x25 and a keyboard and fixed-width fonts. We’re no longer sharing limited memory or CPU cycles on time-sharing mini-computers. 

And text editors have progressed and improved a lot in 20 years. Autocompletion, color-coding, language recognition and macros are all part of modern text editors. Sure, these things have been back-ported and bolted on to `vi` to make Vim, but how has the process of producing, editing, reviewing and reading text improved?

I switched to [BBEdit](http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.html) in the late 1990’s on the Mac (still my hammer tool today) and to [UltraEdit](http://www.ultraedit.com) on PC’s. And became more productive. Fonts, tabs, scrolling, color coding, keyboard mapping, macros, copy and paste, all available. I used Borland’s amazing Turbo IDE’s to program in [Pascal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Pascal) and it was brilliant. And these days, I use Microsoft’s lovely [Visual Studio](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/) for C# and Apple’s [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) for programming iOS. For the last 6 years I’ve been using [TextMate](http://macromates.com) for Ruby on Rails work. Amazingly productive.

***I have never been more productive editing text than I am today with the tools of today.***

So what gives with the move to Vim? It’s like moving from a modern motor car back to puttering in a horse and buggy. I don’t get it. You can be as or more productive in a modern editor like TextMate knowing its shortcuts and using a trackpad than with Vim. *I know, because I am.* TextMate, even the 2 alpha, looks better, works better, displays text better, helps you program better, presents features and preferences better, installs easier and helps me make fewer mistakes.

Alex Payne writing in [On The Flight to Old Text Editors](http://al3x.net/2008/10/22/on-flight-to-old-text-editors.html) had the same problem in 2008 and concluded:

{% blockquote %}
That a new generation of programmers flocking to these old tools is concerning, if for no reason more selfish than the desire for peers in my dissatisfaction. Without a consensus that we can do better, there’s no incentive, no motivation, no market for improvements. If as modest a step towards a better editor as TextMate is abandoned, what hope is there for a true leap forward?
{% endblockquote %}

I, for one, want text editors to get even better than what we have and would purchase and use that leap forward product in an instant. Anything that makes text editors *better* and *me more productive* is a good thing. [BBEdit](http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.html), [TextMate 2](https://github.com/textmate/textmate) and [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) are currently the leaders, but I want to know what’s next and who is working on this next leap forward. I’ll happily switch to it.
