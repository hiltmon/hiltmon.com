Brilliant post by Wil Shipley on his blog called [The Mac App Store Needs Paid Upgrades](http://blog.wilshipley.com/2012/03/mac-app-store-needs-paid-upgrades.html), well worth a read:

{% blockquote %}
Right now developers selling through the Mac App Store face a lose/lose choice: either provide all major upgrades to existing customers for free (thus losing a quarter of our revenue), or create a “new” product for each major version (creating customer confusion) and charge existing customers full price again (creating customer anger).
{% endblockquote %}

Here's hoping Apple is listening.
