So this week, Yahoo paid $30 million to acquire Summly and it's 17 year old founder Nick D'Aloisio (just Google it).

The way I read the deal:

* Summly and its product is going to be shut down.  <span class="light">So it's not the product they wanted.</span>
* Nick only has to hang around for 18 months to get all his money.  <span class="light">So it's not the founder they wanted.</span>
* Summly licensed its technology from someone else, so Yahoo is not getting any IP in the deal either.  <span class="light">So it's not the tech they wanted.</span>

This has to be the most *puzzling* deal ever!

So here is my *brilliant* offer:

You can aquihire me for $60 million.
{% endblockquote %}

And for that ridiculously **cheap** bargain-basement price, I'll give you a better deal with better terms:

* You get a guy, that's me, whose been programming longer than Nick's been alive! I know stuff and get stuff done!  <span class="light">You get the founder.</span>
* There's no product to shut down ([Kifu](http://www.kifuapp.com) is a separate company), so you don't get any disgruntled users or bad press in this deal.  <span class="light">You get all my other products and no bad press.</span>
* I have no IP that's licensed from anyone else, I can and have made my own, so no strings attached.  <span class="light">You get all the tech.</span>
* I'll stick around, for years if you like. I won't just hang around the cafeteria for 18 months eating hamburgers and then bug out finish school or start university (Been there, done that!). I'll focus on making your products *awesomer*!  <span class="light">I'll actually do something for you.</span>

**What a bargain!**

I cannot imagine anyone **not** taking this *amazing* cut-price deal up.
