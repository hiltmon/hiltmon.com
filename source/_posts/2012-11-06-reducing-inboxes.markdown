We've all heard about [Inbox Zero](http://inboxzero.com), where you try to reclaim your email, your attention and your life by clearing out your email inbox. I needed to reduce the *number* of inboxes first.

Those of us who have been on the Internet for decades have amassed a large number of email addresses on a variety of services. As time passed, and new services emerged, we added more. Most of us are loathe to close any of these addresses down *just in case* we get an email there. Which means setting them up every time we set up a new device, and checking them regularly. That is not productive!

Me, I have ten (10). Ten *different* mail servers where I can receive emails from. Not only that, but several of these implement many name variants, so I have many many more actual email addresses, e.g. hiltmon@xxx.com, hilton@xxx.com, hlipschitz@xxx.com, and support@xxx.com.

Ten is too much. So I reduced them to four (4). How?

Easily. You see, most email servers and services have the ability to auto-forward any emails received to another address. Most also allow you to delete the email once forwarded so you do not run out of space. All I did was set forwarding up.

So:

* My oldest, still active, email address from **hotmail** (now called **outlook**) now forwards to **gmail**.
* My second oldest account, which I never use, email address from **yahoo** also forwards to **gmail**.
* My family domain emails from **lippies** also forward to **gmail**.
* My last hedge-fund's emails, **agamascapital**, have not been relevant all year, so they no longer forward anywhere, and I no longer monitor it.
* The company we set up after the last hedge-fund, **envisioncp** forwards to my current company email **noverse**.
* This site's emails, **hiltmon**, forward to my company **noverse** as well, since I now treat this site as a writing platform and no longer a family photo site.

This leaves me with four (4) servers to check:

* **noverse** for all *work* related email
* **gmail** for all *personal* email
* **shukaico** for all [Kifu](http://www.kifuapp.com) email
* **icloud** for all Apple email (and I'm thinking of forwarding these to **gmail** too)

Now that I have reduced the *number* of inboxes, it's a lot easier to process email. And it's easier for people who email me to know *which* account to use (see the need in my [Email Etiquette](http://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/10/24/email-etiquette/) article).
