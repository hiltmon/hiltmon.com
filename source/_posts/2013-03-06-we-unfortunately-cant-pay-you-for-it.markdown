Nate Thayer, in [A Day in the Life of a Freelance Journalist—2013](http://natethayer.wordpress.com/2013/03/04/a-day-in-the-life-of-a-freelance-journalist-2013/) reports on an email conversation with The Atlantic, a news organization with *13 million subscribers*, responding to their request for him to write something for them but **"We unfortunately can’t pay you for it"**:

{% blockquote %}
I am a professional journalist who has made my living by writing for 25 years and am not in the habit of giving my services for free to for profit media outlets so they can make money by using my work and efforts by removing my ability to pay my bills and feed my children. 
{% endblockquote %}

Right there with you, brother, just in software.
