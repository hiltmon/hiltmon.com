There is no right time to start selling.

* If you have a great idea, you should be talking about it, you should be selling it.
* If you have an alpha level product, you should be finding beta testers, you should be selling it.
* If you have a beta level product, you should know what the final product will look like, you should be selling it.
* If the product is done, you should be selling it.
* If you meet someone, you should tell them what you are doing, you should be selling it. 
* If you are in a bar, and are trying to meet girls, you should be selling it (in this case, yourself).
* When you run down the street for some milk, dress nice, you never know if you will bump into someone, you should be selling.

The most successful CEO's are the one who are always selling their ideas and their companies. The most successful sports stars are always selling their sport, their team and their sponsor's products. The most successful sales people are always selling their products. The most successful people picking up in bars are always selling. Those vacuous celebrities in the papers and on TV are always selling something.

You never know who will be listening, or who your listener will tell, but unless you are talking about your ideas, your products or your business, they'll never know.  They may not be interested in your product or service, but they may know someone who would be.

This Hiltmonism does not imply that this is all you should talk about. Thats just creepy, and boring. And I don't mean trying to close a sale either, just a small pitch here and there. Selling is all about sharing information, communication and in delivering the right amount of both.

Selling is actually quite easy. Do not be shy to tell people what you are thinking, making, doing, creating or working on. Have a short, 2-3 sentence pitch that's friendly, not at all pushy, covers the name and the nature of the product or service and is a tad catchy. Deliver it with a smile, quickly, quietly but passionately, in a confident tone and with a touch of understatement.  If the listener is interested, they'll ask for more. You should have that too. And if they are not interested, that's fine too, they will remember the quick pitch, file it away, and will tell others about it when the topic comes up.  You'll be amazed what people remember.

So always be selling.

Just don't be a dick about it.
