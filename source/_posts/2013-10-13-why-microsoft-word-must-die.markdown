Charles Stross, yes, *that* Charles Stross writes in [Why Microsoft Word must Die](http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2013/10/why-microsoft-word-must-die.html):

{% blockquote %}
The .doc file format was also obfuscated, deliberately or intentionally: rather than a parseable document containing formatting and macro metadata, it was effectively a dump of the in-memory data structures used by word, with pointers to the subroutines that provided formatting or macro support.
{% endblockquote %}

He focuses on the usability issues, the compatibility issues, the inconstancies and the forced need to upgrade just to read other people's documents - and the idiocy of using this incomprehensible, short lived format in publishing. 

And that's the key, the file format is a disaster. If you use Word, these days you cannot open Word files you created more than 10 years ago! I tried! *Then again, those files may just be corrupted from years of copying from device to device as I upgraded and changed systems.* But that's the point, a parseable format would still enable me to get *some* content back!

Like Charles, I use [Scrivener](http://www.literatureandlatte.com) for the big stuff and plain old Markdown files for everything else. Like Charles, I'm not worried about being able to read my documents 5 years or 50 years into the future anymore. And like Charles, if someone wants a file in Word format, I'll deliver a copy and keep the original in a manageable format.
