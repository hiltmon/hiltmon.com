Jacqui Cheng over at Ars Technica reminds us that [iOS developers go into 2012 still battling patent troll Lodsys](http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2011/12/ios-developers-go-into-2012-still-slugging-against-patent-troll-lodsys.ars?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss). Of course she interviewed [Mike Lee](http://mur.mu.rs):

{% blockquote %}
"We analyzed the ubiquitous criminal nature of these companies," Lee told Ars. "There is nothing you can do to prevent yourself from being targeted, regardless of platform, and regardless of how careful you are, because this is not patent infringement, it is simple extortion, and it is worldwide."
{% endblockquote %}

Keeping an eye on the [Appsterdam Legal Foundation](http://appsterdamlegalfoundation.org/) and the [Appsterdam](http://appsterdam.rs/) movement in general.
