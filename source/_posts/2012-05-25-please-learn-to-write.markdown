Michael Lopp, writing in Rands in Repose, counterpoints the current meme of "Learning to Code" in [Please Learn to Write](http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2012/05/16/please_learn_to_write.html), great article. Love how he compares writing to programming:

{% blockquote %}
Writing appears more forgiving because there is no compiler or interpreter catching your its/it’s issues or reminding you of the rules regarding that or which. Here’s the rub: there is a compiler and it’s fucking brutal. It’s your readers. Your readers are far more critical than the Python interpreter. Not only do they care about syntax, but they also want to learn something, and, perhaps, be entertained while all this learning is going down. Success means they keep coming back - failure is a lonely silence. Python is looking pretty sweet now, right?
