Rob Galankis tongue-in-cheek writing in [Why I hate Test Driven Development](http://altdevblogaday.com/2012/03/30/why-i-hate-tdd/):
 
{% blockquote %}
... So why do I hate TDD?

Because debugging is fun. There, I said it. I love debugging. I think lots of clever people like debugging. I love someone having a problem, coming to me, looking at it together, getting up to walk around, look at the ceiling, talk to myself, stand in front of a whiteboard, draw some lines that spark some idea, try it, manually test a fix out, slouch down in my chair staring at my computer lost in thought, and repeating this until I actually find and fix the problem.
{% endblockquote %}

I don't mind debugging when there is no deadline. I love TDD when there is.
