A great article by Ben Brooks called [Fragility of Free](http://brooksreview.net/2011/03/fragility-free/), well worth a read:

{% blockquote %}
The fragility of free is a catchy term that describes what happens when the free money runs out. Or — perhaps more accurately — when the investors/founders/venture capitalists run out of cash, or patience, or both. Because at some point Twitter and all other companies have to make the move from ‘charity’ to ‘business’ — or, put another way, they have to make the move from spending tons of money to making slightly more money than they spend.
{% endblockquote %}

I also like to, and do prefer to, pay for things.
