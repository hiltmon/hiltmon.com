Lovely article on how the stalwart classic [BBEdit](http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.html) still rules by Andy Ihnatko ([@ihnatko](http://twitter.com/ihnatko)) on Macworld today, entitled [Mac classics: Why BBEdit rules](http://www.macworld.com/article/2011461/mac-classics-why-bbedit-rules.html)

“BBEdit’s still important because at its essential core, it’s a tool for working with text,” says Rich Siegel, Bare Bones Software’s founder and CEO. “Not text for presentation, as in a word processor or page-layout application, but rather text as data supplied to other software: code for compilers and interpreters, markup and Web applications for Web browsers, log files and data tables for analysis, and for any tool that inhales raw text and turns it into something else.”

I use BBEdit *every **single** day*, for all sorts of crazy things. It’s my go-to “hammer” tool.
