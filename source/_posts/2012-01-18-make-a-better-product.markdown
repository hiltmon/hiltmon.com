Rich Siegel, of [BBEdit](http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.html) fame, in his blog article [Bar Sopa](http://rms2.tumblr.com/post/16065567721/bar-sopa), makes the right point on piracy:

{% blockquote %}
A good way to do this is to make a product for which more people want to pay a fair price than who are willing to steal it.
{% endblockquote %}

and

{% blockquote %}
Take the money you would have spent on fighting piracy and use it to make a better product and/or service. Making more laws is not the answer.
{% endblockquote %}
