Classic article by Paul Graham in 2009 called [Maker's Schedule, Manager's Schedule](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html).

One reason programmers dislike meetings so much is that they're on a different type of schedule from other people. Meetings cost them more.

When you're operating on the maker's schedule, meetings are a disaster. A single meeting can blow a whole afternoon, by breaking it into two pieces each too small to do anything hard in. Plus you have to remember to go to the meeting.

One of the reasons I went indie is to stay on my own maker's schedule.
