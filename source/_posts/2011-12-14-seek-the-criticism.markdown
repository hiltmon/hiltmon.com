Brendan Baker nails it in [Fuck the Accolades. Seek the Criticism](http://www.quora.com/Brendan-Baker/Fuck-the-Accolades-Seek-the-Criticism) on Quora.  Just read it. It's short.

{% blockquote %}
Two productive things can come out of a meeting with a VC:

1) They help you directly. Money or connections.

2) They make you better. They criticize you where it counts. They poke holes. They make you defend. They make you justify. They make you question.
{% endblockquote %}

Seek the criticism, because accolades don't help you.
