[@yongfook](https://twitter.com/#!/yongfook), writing in [Design is Horseshit!](http://yongfook.com/post/14295124427/design-is-horseshit), makes a good point:

{% blockquote %}
Focus on value creation. Design enhances value, it does not create it. Stop creating shitty startups that look amazing.
{% endblockquote %}

He's not saying that you should dump design and designers (*phew!*), just that he is sick of over-designed new startups that provide no real value.

Money quote:

{% blockquote %}
Think hard about what problem you can solve that a customer will give you $10 for and work your ass off at delivering that $10 of value as fast and as cheaply as possible.
{% endblockquote %}
