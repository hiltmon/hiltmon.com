Kevin Fogarty, writing in [Best idea of 2011: Give control of Internet content to group that sued a dead grandmother](http://m.itworld.com/security/234685/best-idea-2011-give-control-internet-content-group-sued-dead-grandmother) via IT World, goes after the backers of SOPA, especially the RIAA.

{% blockquote %}
The anti-piracy enforcement arm of the RIAA has, for almost a decade, been so aggressive about investigating, suing and attempting to prosecute those it accused of illegally downloading movies or music that it was sued by illegal investigatory practices and invasion of privacy, for fraud, conspiracy and extortion, deceptive business practices and violation of the RICO statutes normally used to prosecute bosses of organized crime families.
{% endblockquote %}

And they *paid* Congress for SOPA.
