Mike Masnyck, writing in Techdirt asks a valid question: [Shouldn't There Be Significant Punishment For Bogus Copyright Claims That Kill Companies?](http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20111229/03234617223/shouldnt-their-be-significant-punishment-bogus-copyright-claims-that-kill-companies.shtml)

{% blockquote %}
If enforcing their rights involves completely destroying someone else's company, then, as Goldman notes, shouldn't it be difficult? 
{% endblockquote %}

Fighting a copyright claim costs at least 1 million dollars in legal fees, *whether or not the claim is valid*. Companies with deep pockets can and do use bogus claims to road-kill new competitors. For example, Luma Labs and their [amazing camera straps](http://luma-labs.com/blogs/news/4540122-an-open-letter-to-our-customers-past-and-future).  How can we stop this?
