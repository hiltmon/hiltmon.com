Lets take a look at the Widget market. It's maturing but still expanding, with sales growing to about 2 million a quarter.

An experienced investor, looking at fundamentals, history and buyer preferences, will expect *Peach* to sell 1 million Widgets and *Pear* to sell about 250 thousand, with the remaining Widgets being sold by others.

But lets assume the presence of an Analyst that wants to drive *Peach's* stock down, and wants to promote *Pear*. They want to do this because that Analyst's firm makes more money when *Pear* shares, securities and derivatives trade.

The Analyst cannot say *Peach* will sell 2 million widgets this quarter, that's the whole market and will seem like an unreasonably large and implausible number to their clients. They also cannot say the correct number they expect based on fundamentals, because if *Peach* achieves that number (very likely it will) then the *Peach* stock price will go up, not what their employer wants. So the Analyst picks a number that sounds reasonable, but is made up, that will achieve their goal.

Lets say the Analyst picks 1.25 million sales. On the surface it seems a reasonable, if high, expectation. A long pass if you will.

On the other hand, the Analyst calls 150 thousand sales for *Pear*, also not unreasonable, a 2 yard rush, especially if *Peach* is growing quickly.

Then *Peach* announces its earnings. Revenue is up, profits are up, cash is up, debt is nonexistent and market share is up on great sales of 1.1 million Widgets. It is, in fact, *Peach's* best quarter ever. Fundamentally, *Peach* just proved itself to be a more valuable company and it's share price should rise.

The press and the Analyst report the *Peach* earnings **as a miss**, because *Peach* reported fewer Widgets sold than the Analyst made-up number claimed was expected, and the *Peach* stock price tanks. The Analyst's company wins.

Later that week, *Pear* announces its earnings. Revenue is down, profits are negative, margins are down, market share is down, and debt is up on sales of 200 thousand Widgets. All in all, a shitty quarter by all measures for *Pear*. Fundamentally, this company looks worse, the prognosis is that it's getting worse and it's share price should drop.

The press and the Analyst report that *Pear* **beat** expectations and the *Pear* share price rises instead. It seems that *Pear* did better than the intentionally low-ball figure chosen. The Analyst's company wins again.

It makes no sense. Fundamentally, economically, and return-wise,  *Peach* is a good, sustainable business and *Pear* is a money-burning disaster heading over a cliff. Yet *Pear* shares go up and *Peach* shares go down.

Now replace *Peach* with Apple and *Pear* with, well, anyone else in the same space (or use Amazon if you wish).

It makes no sense. It's wrong. Yet this is how it really works on Wall Street these days. And it's perfectly legal.

I am expecting this scenario to play out tonight at the Apple earnings call, and at the next, and the next. Just like the last one and the one before. And there is nothing we can do about it.
