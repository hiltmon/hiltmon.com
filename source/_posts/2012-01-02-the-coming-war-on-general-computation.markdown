Excellent talk by Cory Doctorow on [The coming war on general computation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUEvRyemKSg), transcript [here](https://github.com/jwise/28c3-doctorow/blob/master/transcript.md), talking about the war between copyright holders and reality, and why it needs to be fought:

{% blockquote %}
So when I get into a car -- a computer I put my body into -- with my hearing aid -- a computer I put inside my body -- I want to know that these technologies are not designed to keep secrets from me, and to prevent me from terminating processes on them that work against my interests.
{% endblockquote %}

In short, the only way to protect copyright is to fill general purpose computers with surveillance malware and spyware, to give control to these processes to the government or holders, and in removing the user's ability to detect and terminate these processes. And the purpose of these processes is to spy on and work against the general person's interests.

I got the link for this from an article called [Richard Stallman Was Right All Along](http://www.osnews.com/story/25469/Richard_Stallman_Was_Right_All_Along) on OS News.

I have always looked upon Stallman as an extreme nutter, but maybe he's been right all along. About the free software thing, not the bearded hippie toe jam eating thing.
