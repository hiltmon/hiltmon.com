For those of you who, like me, have already switched to Textmate 2 alpha as a daily programmer's editor, check out [Textmate 2 Tips](http://tm2tips.tumblr.com/) on tumblr. Lots of useful tips there.

Its just so nice to have [Textmate](http://macromates.com/) being updated again. Already added the RailsCasts theme, SCSS and Marked bundles manually, and still getting used to the new File Browser.
