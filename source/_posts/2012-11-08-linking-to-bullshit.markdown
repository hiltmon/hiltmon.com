While I was working on my [Adverse Apple Articles](https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/11/08/adverse-apple-articles/) post this morning, Marco Arment was writing this: [Linking to bullshit](http://www.marco.org/2012/11/07/linking-to-bullshit):

{% blockquote %}
If you truly dislike bullshit writing and don’t want to support it, hit the publishers where it hurts: don’t read it, and don’t link to it.
{% endblockquote %}

I only partially agree. If the site and the article is truly link bait, then sure, we should ignore it and not send others to it.

**But** if the article is being read by a *lot* of people and is intentionally misinforming them, I think we should call them out and correct it. Otherwise the spin and lies will propagate.
