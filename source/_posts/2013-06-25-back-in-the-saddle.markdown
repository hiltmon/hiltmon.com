*TL;DR: I got a job! Gonna keep writing though.*

As of this week, I'm *back in the saddle* in the finance industry, designing and developing leading edge platforms and systems for a new asset manager, my favorite kind of business.  The challenges in the new firm are new to me and epic. And I love a good challenge.

How does this affect...

* **My current consulting customers?** Nothing changes, all your projects are in support and the support levels will continue unaffected. I will not, however, be taking on new consulting engagements.
* **My blog?** I *love* writing, and will continue to spend evenings and weekends writing and hopefully improving my craft. Actually, I think this blog may get even *more* geeky as I am using some very cool, modern open-source products and will likely *nerd* all over them and *just have to* share.
* **My products?** Of course, they too will be supported and upgraded as needed. [TimeToCall](https://hiltmon.com/timetocall/) will get an iOS 7 facelift, and [Kifu](http://www.kifuapp.com) is already rock solid.

I have enjoyed the past few years being an indie consultant (<span class="light">other than working for a royal *pain-in-the-arse* -- oh, wait, um, that's me!</span>) and delivering some amazing products to a bunch of wonderful customers. It has enabled me to become proficient an a whole bunch of new technologies, be exposed to new industries and processes, face and defeat untold challenges, and to make a lot of new friends like you.

I might be *working for the man* from now on, but that is all that really changes.
