Randy Murray presents a different view in [An Observer From Shenzhen—Thoughts on Apple’s Recent Bad Press](http://whowritesforyou.com/2012/02/02/an-observer-from-shenzhen-thoughts-on-apples-recent-bad-press/).

{% blockquote %}
Do workers in Foxconn factories who build products for Apple, Dell, HP, and others, work long hours at tedious tasks? Yes they do. Do they work for a fraction of what a worker in the US, Japan, or even Korea would? Yes they do.

Are they being enslaved? Clearly, they are not.

I suspect that a lot of the heat from the recent press comes from a lack of understanding about Chinese culture, their rapid change from manual agrarian life to high-tech manufacturing, and the significant differences and scales of our economies.
{% endblockquote %}

I don't know what the truth is, but I am glad to see a reasonable dissenting discussion on this issue.
