Daniel Jalkut, writing in his Red Sweater blog in [The End Of Advertising](http://www.red-sweater.com/blog/2367/the-end-of-advertising):

{% blockquote %}
If I want to know what a lawnmower is, Google. If I want to know which lawnmower to buy? Amazon, or another site that strives to empower customers, not advertisers.
{% endblockquote %}

I think we all do this without knowing it.
