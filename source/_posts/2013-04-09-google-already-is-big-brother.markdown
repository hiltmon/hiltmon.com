You can, and probably already do, most of these *without* paying any money <span class="light">(in no particular order)</span>:

1. Use Google's browser [Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/) to visit web pages, which tell [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/) what you did
2. Find information using [Google Search](http://www.google.com), which tracks and saves your searches, search attempts and selections; with the results customized by Google's model of you
3. Jump to your favorite sites using a [Google Toolbar](http://toolbar.google.com/intl/en/) extension or built-in search that checks each site you visit
4. Send and receive all your personal email via [Gmail](http://mail.google.com) (and probably work emails too), analyzed and filtered by [Postini](http://www.google.com/postini/)
5. Find out whats going on (and should be going on) in your life and around you using [Google Now](http://www.google.com/landing/now/)

13. Call internationally using [Google Voice](http://voice.google.com/)
14. Read the news via [Google News](http://news.google.com/nwshp?hl=en) and get your feeds via [Feedburner](http://feedburner.google.com)
15. Watch TV and other Video on [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/)
16. Read books from [Google Books](http://books.google.com/books?hl=en)
17. Listen to tunes from [Google Play](http://play.google.com/)
18. Find a restaurant using [Zagat](http://www.zagat.com)
19. Plan you next vacation on [Frommers](http://www.frommers.com)
20. Log in to other services using your Google ID and OAuth

23. Save your files on [Google Drive](http://drive.google.com/)
24. Track your shares and investments on [Google Finance](http://www.google.com/finance)
25. Click on ads served by Google, [DoubleClick](http://www.google.com/doubleclick/), [AdMob](http://www.google.com/ads/admob/), [AdMeld](http://www.admeld.com), Teracent, and AdScape
26. Create, edit and collaborate using [Google Apps](http://www.google.com/apps/index1.html)

29. Access the internet over [Google fiber](https://fiber.google.com/about/) <span class="light">(OK, so this costs some money)</span>
30. And then there's [bookmarks](http://www.google.com/bookmarks/), [offers](http://www.google.com/offers?utm_source=xsell&utm_medium=el&utm_campaign=moreproducts), [iGoogle](http://www.google.com/ig?hl=en&source=mpes), [translation](http://translate.google.com/?hl=en), [alerts](http://www.google.com/alerts?hl=en) and [scholar](http://www.google.com/schhp?hl=en).

Not sure? Click the above links and see how many redirect to a *personalized* view for you versus a public common page.  <span class="light">I was surprised how many were personalized for me.</span>

If you are *mostly-in* on Google, you have no secrets from Google. Your data is sold to nameless, faceless corporations who are Google's true customers. Your access to information is screened and controlled by Google's mysterious algorithms, filtering, service terms and whims which work *for the greater good*. Your screen is filled with targeted advertising based on Google's knowledge of you and what they think people like you would *or should* like.

Clearly, Google *is* the Big Brother out of Orwell's 1984 that we mindlessly volunteered our precious secrets to and blindly follow its recommendations. But it's so *easy* and *convenient* and *cheap* and "*I've got nothing to hide*".

*Sigh!*
