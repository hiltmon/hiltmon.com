Graham Morehead, writing in nature.com in [CEOs and the Candle Problem](http://blogs.nature.com/a_mad_hemorrhage/2012/04/02/ceos-and-the-candle-problem) starts:

{% blockquote %}
In America we have a motivation problem : money. I'm not a communist. I love capitalism (I even love money), but here's a simple fact we've known since 1962: using money as a motivator makes us less capable at problem-solving. It actually makes us dumber. 
{% endblockquote %}

Then he goes on to talk about the [Candle problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candle_problem) and [Functional fixedness](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_fixedness), using them to explain how some CEO's who are improperly motivated by money drive their businesses into ruin, something we have all seen in action.

My takeaway from this as an indie (and CEO of a one-person company) is always to keep focus on why I am an indie - to make great products that I am passionate about. More money would be nice though.
