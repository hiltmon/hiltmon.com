Excellent post by Aaron Mahnke called [Entitlement](http://aaronmahnke.com/blog/2012/9/27/entitlement) about all those moaning about the new iPhone (although I think it applies to all new products), please read and share it:

{% blockquote %}
Where is the sense of gratitude and wonder that we used to have? A tech company sells millions and millions of an amazing smart phone, but decided to create a new model by investing untold amounts of money and energy. And then they released it for the same price as the last model. They didn't have to, but they did. To moan and complain about that smacks of entitlement and selfishness.
{% endblockquote %}
