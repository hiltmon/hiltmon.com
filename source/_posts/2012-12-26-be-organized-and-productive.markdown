The theme of 2012 was all about getting organized and productive using software. I may have spent 2012 developing [Kifu](http://www.kifuapp.com) and some internal applications for clients, but I spent a lot of time this year getting better organized and more productive on my Mac. *It’s ridiculous how much this has paid off.*

So, instead of a *cool-products-of-2012-year-in-review* post, here are many of the things I do and tools I use to be organized and productive, with thanks to those to shared the ideas with us. Maybe these ideas, tools and folks can help you too.

## Getting Organized

To me, being organized is for everything to have its place and for it to be easily found in that place.

* **All todo’s in [OmniFocus](http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=V41G*FiMqjc&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fomnifocus%252Fid402835630%253Fmt%253D12%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30)**: I have been using OmniFocus since it came out on *all* my devices. This year I reinvented how I use it twice, and I am still working on improving it. Everything I need to do goes in to OmniFocus, everything, an action, a reminder, a bill, a software feature. With a single `F11` keystroke, I get the quick entry box from anywhere to capture a new to do.
* **All time in [Billings](http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=V41G*FiMqjc&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fbillings%252Fid402368702%253Fmt%253D12%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30)**: Every minute I spend working on anything gets tracked in Billings, even my own personal project work. It gives me a great baseline for estimating future work, as well as tracking and billing *real* client work.
* **All projects in standard folders**: All current projects are now organized in my [Project Folder Layout](http://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/06/30/project-folder-layout/) so it’s easy to navigate to files when needed, easy to know where to find files and easy to know where to save them.
* **All text documents are in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)**: All contracts, reports, notes, documentation, knowledge base articles, blog posts, anything that gets written on all my devices is in Markdown (actually [MultiMarkdown](http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/)) format. It’s plan text, cross platform, very searchable, extremely readable and ubiquitous. See [The Markdown Mindset](http://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/02/20/the-markdown-mindset/).
* **Project reference data is in [VoodooPad](http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=V41G*FiMqjc&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fvoodoopad-5%252Fid514489722%253Fmt%253D12%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30)**: All contacts (client and third party), IP addresses, server names, logins, passwords, and other project level information are stored in a single VoodooPad document in the project root. I no longer struggle to come back to projects and figure out who to call and how to get things done.
* **All non-project notes are in [nvAlt](http://brettterpstra.com/project/nvalt/)**: Any other non-project related notes, call logs, ideas, and scratchings are edited in [BBEdit](http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=V41G*FiMqjc&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fbbedit%252Fid404009241%253Fmt%253D12%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30) and stored in nvAlt’s folder in Markdown files, shared using [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com), using [standard file names](http://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/04/15/text-notes-going-electronic/). I can find a note using nvAlt’s built-in search quicker than anything. And I can edit notes on any device seamlessly.
* **All bills are electronically filed and named**: I have moved to paperless billing everywhere and file all bills in their correct folders using [Hazel](http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel.php). The filer also creates a to do in OmniFocus so I never forget to pay a bill.
* **All passwords are strong and in [1Password](http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=V41G*FiMqjc&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252F1password-password-manager%252Fid443987910%253Fmt%253D12%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30)**: I moved from a single simple password for all sites and applications to unique strong passwords for each, easily accessible using shortcuts from 1Password. Safer too, and synced via [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com).
* **All social interaction logged in [Day One](http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=V41G*FiMqjc&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fday-one%252Fid422304217%253Fmt%253D12%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30)**: Using [SLogger](http://ttscoff.github.com/Slogger/) I capture all my tweets, posts, instagrams, facebooks, web stats and stock prices into Day One. It’s a live journal of what happened every day, without me having to write it.
* **All source code in [GitHub](https://github.com)**: I moved all source code from `svn` to `git` this year, and back it up on GitHub in private and public repositories. And I am in the habit of `git push origin` all the time in case things go wrong.
* **The big backup to [Backblaze](http://www.backblaze.com)**: I took backup to the next level this year moving beyond Time Machine and manual disk clones to an offsite backup using Backblaze. It just works.
* **Key files are saved and replicated using [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com)**: My notes, passwords, journal, BBEdit settings, and key encrypted files are all kept in Dropbox folders for anywhere access. It’s the first application I install on any new device, followed by 1Password.
* **Key processes and big data are now on the Server**: I have an old Mac Pro running OS X Server, hosting SLogger, my production server backups, old files, and all my music, photos and videos on RAID drives, so that they no longer need to be on my Laptop. And I don’t need to leave it running all the time either.

## Getting Productive

To me, productivity is all about doing less to get more done.

* **Keystroke based automation using [Keyboard Maestro](http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=V41G*FiMqjc&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fkeyboard-maestro%252Fid406298247%253Fmt%253D12%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30)**: Keyboard Maestro gives me the ability to do a lot of things with a single keystroke, from launching a set of [contextual applications](http://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/04/26/application-context-packs/) to creating markdown links. The longer I use this, the more macros I create, the faster I work.
* **Background file organization using [Hazel](http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel.php)**: Hazel keeps my desktop clean, files my bills from Downloads, and archives old data. It handles all the maintenance tasks I used to do manually, and without the human error.
* **Typing repetitive text with [TextExpander](http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=V41G*FiMqjc&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Ftextexpander-for-mac%252Fid405274824%253Fmt%253D12%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30)**: I must have over a hundred of my own expansions in TextExpander, from terminal commands, file names, email text, symbols, macros to names, numbers and addresses. I save hundreds of keystrokes a day using it.
* **Scripts and Macros for Terminal**: Since I have been spending a great deal of time in the UNIX terminal this year, I now have a bunch of scripts and bash functions to speed things up. It’s amazing what you can do when you start writing scripts to automate stuff.
* **One-key todo creation in [OmniFocus](http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=V41G*FiMqjc&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fomnifocus%252Fid402835630%253Fmt%253D12%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30)**: `F11` and OmniFocus is there. And I now never forget what I need to get done.
* **Quick calendar management using [Fantastical](http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=V41G*FiMqjc&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Ffantastical%252Fid435003921%253Fmt%253D12%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30)**: I hide most menu-bar extensions using [Bartender](http://www.macbartender.com), but *not* Fantastical. I can launch it with a keystroke and start typing the appointment details in plain text. Fantastical magically interprets it and creates the event.
* **Quick launch and search with [Alfred](http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=V41G*FiMqjc&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Falfred%252Fid405843582%253Fmt%253D12%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30)**: I started using Alfred to just launch apps, the same as I used to do in [QuickSilver](http://qsapp.com). But now I also use it to quickly get a Google search, or log in to a site using stored 1Passwords, or search notes using a file filter, or navigate to a file. As a result, my dock is now hidden.
* **Spatial layouts with [Moom](http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=V41G*FiMqjc&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fmoom%252Fid419330170%253Fmt%253D12%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30)**: I love working spatially, I find myself much more productive if my windows are where I expect them to be. I have set up Moom with keyboard shortcuts to place my windows where they need to be.
* **Automatic file sync using [ChronoSync](http://www.econtechnologies.com/pages/cs/chrono_overview.html) and [ChronoAgent](http://www.econtechnologies.com/pages/ca/agent_overview.html)**: As soon as the desktop computer wakes up, ChronoSync wakes up too and ensures that the files on the Laptop and Desktop are the same. It’s easy for me to switch between them and trust the files are all ready to go when I run out of the office.
* **Better programmer editing with [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com)**: I started to do more and more programming in Sublime Text 2 this year, its plugins and productivity gains are amazing. However the past few weeks, I have been going back to [TextMate 2](https://github.com/textmate/textmate), it just feels more Mac-like. But Sublime Text 2 runs on all platforms, and so I do not lose anything when jumping over to Windows or Linux to code there.
* **Faster calculations using [Soulver](http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=V41G*FiMqjc&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fsoulver%252Fid413965349%253Fmt%253D12%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30)**: I used to either reach for the [HP-12C](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP-12C) or launch [Excel](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel/) to perform calculations too complex to be done in the old noggin. Nowadays, unless it’s a single calc, I use Soulver. Yup, even for project estimates.
* **Faster artwork generation using [Slicy](http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=V41G*FiMqjc&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fslicy%252Fid512533449%253Fmt%253D12%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30)**: I switched to an [Adobe Creative Cloud](http://www.adobe.com/products/creativecloud.html) subscription this year so I am back on the latest [Photoshop](http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html), [Illustrator](http://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html) and [InDesign](http://www.adobe.com/products/indesign.html), these already improve my productivity. But setting up all my artwork using the right folders in Photoshop and using Slicy to generate the application art files has saved me days of work.

## Lesson Learned

It turns out that building the habits to be organized and more productive are easy. In a way, maybe we all have been using computers incorrectly all these years, relying on ourselves to do things that the computer can do perfectly well. It takes no time to get into the habit of starting a timer before working on something, jotting to do’s into [OmniFocus](http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=V41G*FiMqjc&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fomnifocus%252Fid402835630%253Fmt%253D12%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30), leaving [BBEdit](http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=V41G*FiMqjc&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fbbedit%252Fid404009241%253Fmt%253D12%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30) running for note taking, and saving files in standard locations with standard names. It takes no time getting used to the shortcuts needed to kick off [Keyboard Maestro](http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=V41G*FiMqjc&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fkeyboard-maestro%252Fid406298247%253Fmt%253D12%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30) macros, access things quickly in [Alfred](http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=V41G*FiMqjc&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Falfred%252Fid405843582%253Fmt%253D12%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30), save keystrokes using [TextExpander](http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=V41G*FiMqjc&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Ftextexpander-for-mac%252Fid405274824%253Fmt%253D12%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30) expansions or start trusting [Hazel](http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel.php) to take care of things.

There is some investment of time and money to get organized and productive, but the payoff is huge. You will get to spend more time focussing on the task at hand and getting it done, offloading interruptions to tools, speeding through automated repetitive processes and letting the computer do some actual work for you. You will quickly get used to having everything available at your fingertips, in the way you need it when you need it. And you’ll free yourself up to spend more time creating or reading or away from the computer without losing any productivity.
