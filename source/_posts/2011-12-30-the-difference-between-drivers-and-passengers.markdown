Douglas Rushkoff, Author of [Program or Be Programmed](http://www.amazon.com/Program-Be-Programmed-Commands-Digital/dp/1935928155), in an interview on [ReadWriteWeb](http://www.readwriteweb.com/hack/2011/05/douglas-rushkoff-interview.php)

{% blockquote %}
A lot of us our too willing to accept roles as consumers in society. I understand the economic reasons for that, but I don't think it leads to a fulfilling life or a sustainable community. The best way out of this is to deconstruct what you're consuming, or better yet to become a creator yourself.
{% endblockquote %}

I create software. I write a blog. I'm good at one of these things. And I am always the driver.
