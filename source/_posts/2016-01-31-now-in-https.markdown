My host, [Dreamhost](https://www.dreamhost.com/), is offering free web site certificates through [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org), a new initative to make encrypted connections the default standard through the internet. They started with free SSL certificates.

So I turned it on.

Most browsers will be warning against unecrypted web sites *real soon now*, so I thought it best to do this now. 

The only change I seem to need was to change the Google Fonts URLs to `https` as well.

<span class="light">Note: Since the Let's Encrypt root certificates have not yet been deployed to all browsers (especially older ones), you may get a browser message that this site cannot be trusted or verified. Hang in there, and let me know via the comments (with screenshot and date).</span>
