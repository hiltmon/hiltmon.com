Matt Gemmell wrote yet another brilliant post on what makes a great application interface (with examples) in [Augmented Paper](http://mattgemmell.com/2012/04/13/augmented-paper/):

{% blockquote %}
For me, software experiences that feel like Augmented Paper are those that second-guess our (developersâ€™) natural tendency to put functionality first, or to think of our apps as software. Apps are only incidentally software; software is an implementation detail. Instead, apps are experiences.
{% endblockquote %}

Honestly, if you are an app designer, this is a must-read.
