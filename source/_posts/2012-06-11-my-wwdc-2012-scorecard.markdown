I published my [WWDC 2012 Keynote Predictions](http://www.hiltmon.com/blog/2012/06/09/my-wwdc-2012-predictions/) a few days ago, lets see how well I did:

* **Sales**: [0/1] Instead of the boring "we sold a lot", they went emotional, "we helped a lot". Nice, but not worth the 10 minutes as it made them hurry the laptop announcements.
* **Hardware updates** [2/4]
	* No Mac Pro updates (*Correction, they did bump the Mac Pro, just silently, but not to the new E5 CPU's*)
	* Lovely Macbook Pro updates
	* Lovely Air updates
	* And the new Retina Macbook Pro (I was so wrong there)
* **OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion**: [3/3] As expected, we got a release date, no radical new features (except dictation and power nap), and we did get Facebook.
* **iOS 6**: [3/4] Beta, check, new maps, check, updated Siri, check. Did not expect the nice updates to the phone app and the new passbook app, but these do seem incremental.
* **iCloud**: [1/2] Expected more features and got them, shared photostream and cloud tabs stand out. But not all of MobileMe has been replaced.
* **Apple TV**: [1/1] No mention, as expected
* **Apple applications**: [2/3] Expected iCloud updates for iLife and iWork (actually was expecting new versions, but the updates are OK). Did not expect any Pro updates like Aperture.
* **Steve Jobs**: [0/1] No mention
* **No "one more thing"**: [1/1] Check

And on the meta:

* **Liveblogs**: [0/1] Expected failure, they worked great.
* **Missing magical features**: [1/1] Check, lots of complaints about no retina on the Air, no iPhones (duh!), no Siri SDK, no Apple TV.
* **Share Price Drops**: [1/1] Check
* **Not as good as a Stevenote**: [0/1] Crickets, phew, glad to be wrong about that one.

So all in all, out of a possible 24 points, I got 15 right. Pretty average for a set of uninformed keynote predictions.

The winning announcements:

* The new retina MacBook Pro, I want one.
* Retina versions of Photoshop and Aperture, just wow
* Mountain Lion next month
* iOS 6 maps look just lovely
