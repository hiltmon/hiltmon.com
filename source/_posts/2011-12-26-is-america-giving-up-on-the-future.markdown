Umair Haque, writing in the Harvard Business Review in [Is America Giving Up on the Future?](http://blogs.hbr.org/haque/2011/09/is_america_giving_up_on_the_fu.html) writes:

{% blockquote %}
That the wealth of a nation isn't merely the sum of its tradable riches; that a thriving marketplace isn't a big box store; that industrial output matters less than human outcomes; that work that matters yields accomplishments that endure; that Goldman Sachs probably shouldn't be as profitable as Apple, because builders should earn more than shufflers; that the worth of an enduring achievement is denominated in more than mere profit; that how we feel about our lives is worth more than how enviably glamorous they look; that tomorrow matters more — not less — than today.
{% endblockquote %}

"You probably can't Farmville your way into the future."
