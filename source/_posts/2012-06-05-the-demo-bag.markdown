I'm demonstrating software this afternoon, so out comes the demo bag. It's a [Cocoon 15" GRID-IT&trade; Case](http://www.cocooninnovations.com/product_info.php?cat_id=50&product_id=225) (not an affiliate link) that I picked up at the local Apple store.

The things that sold it to me are:

* It's black and conservative looking so no-one knows how cool it is
* It's a hard-ish case, so my goods are protected
* It's the right size for a 15" Macbook Pro, an iPad and related cables, and no bulkier
* But the biggest selling point of all, it has the GRID-IT&trade; system, no more digging around a bag to find the cables and accessories needed in a demo. Just look at it:

The only negative is that the shoulder strap squeaks in the shoulder pad when I walk. But I can live with that.

Of course, engineer me has yet to find the optimal layout of accessories on the actual grid. But the benefit of being able to see and grab an item instantly, just love it.
