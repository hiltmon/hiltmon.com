I have started a new series of articles on [Hedge Fund Systems](http://www.noverse.com/blog/categories/hedge-fund-systems/) on my company, [Noverse LLC](http://www.noverse.com/) blog.  <span class="light">I did not post them here (yet) because I am not sure my readers will be interested â€“ and I am using them to promote my skills and services. Let me know in comments you think I should post them here too.</span>

But just in case you *are* interested in Hedge Fund systems (or my professional skills), the first post is called [The Opportunity](http://www.noverse.com/blog/2013/05/the-opportunity/) where I describe the opportunity I got starting in 2004 to design, develop and grow a brand new end-to-end Hedge Fund system for a completely fresh new business. It was the opportunity of a lifetime, and I took it.

In short, I **did** successfully architect, plan, design and build a feature-complete, integrated platform that ran the business for this Hedge Fund that traded *everything* and grew to over 900mm under management.

Head on over to [The Opportunity](http://www.noverse.com/blog/2013/05/the-opportunity/) to read more. It's a pretty unbelievable, but true, story.
