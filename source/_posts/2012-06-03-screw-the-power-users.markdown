Nick Bradbury in [Screw the Power Users](http://nick.typepad.com/blog/2012/05/screw-the-power-users.html):

{% blockquote %}
We're the ones who made computers so hard to use. And we’ve done it by catering to power users - by building software for people like us instead of for people who don’t know and don’t care about all the geeky little details.
{% endblockquote %}

Couldn't agree more.
