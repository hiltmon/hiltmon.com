Marco Arment, of [Instapaper](http://instapaper.com) and The Magazine fame, went to a Microsoft Store yesterday to try out the new Surface and wrote about the experience in his blog in [An alternate universe](http://www.marco.org/2012/10/26/an-alternate-universe). Go read it. I’ll wait.

I’m sad to say but I think I may have to agree with his conclusion:

{% blockquote %}
But it’s not for me at all. Not even for testing, experimenting, or curiosity. It feels too much like using a Windows PC, which was exactly Microsoft’s intention, and it will appeal to people who want that. But that’s a world I fled 8 years ago with no intention of returning.
{% endblockquote %}
