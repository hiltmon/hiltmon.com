I've compiled a list of my favorite Mac apps for 2011.  Just wanted to mention the ones that make my life that much easier. I am intentionlly excluding all built-in applications or anything from Apple, such as [iWork](http://www.apple.com/iwork/), [iLife](http://www.apple.com/ilife/) and [Aperture](http://www.apple.com/aperture/) which are mainstays. 

Some you may know, some you may not.

## Writing and Programming

* [Xcode 4](http://developer.apple.com/xcode/) - Used a lot at the start of the year for iOS programming
* [BBEdit](http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.html) - Always running, [BBedit](http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.html) is my go-to application for viewing files, editing, scratch pad, project note pad and other stuff. I do all my notes in [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), and although I own [Marked](http://markedapp.com/), I still use [BBEdit's](http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.html) preview window with my own CSS for sending notes.
* [TextMate 2](http://macromates.com/) - I am working on two [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) projects, lived in [TextMate](http://macromates.com/) 1 until the alpha of 2 was released and am using that one now for all [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) work.
* [Byword](http://bywordapp.com/) - I really wanted to like [iAWriter](http://www.iawriter.com/), it has a great font, but for writing smaller articles, including this blog post, I rely on [Byword](http://bywordapp.com/). As soon as I open it, I feel like writing.
* [Scrivener](http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php) - For larger documentation projects, nothing comes close to [Scrivener](http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php).  I use it for all project documentation deliverables, including specifications and reports, and I love how it keeps everything together.

## Art

* [Xscope](http://iconfactory.com/software/xscope) - This is a must-have, I use it all the time to get my web designs pixel perfect.
* [OmniGraffle](http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnigraffle/) - Use it for wireframing, diagramming or just making a quick graphic to share. Then again, I love all of [Omni's](http://www.omnigroup.com/) products.
* [Adobe Illustrator](http://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html) - Still the tool to go to for vector art, even the old version that I have, but am really thinking of moving to [Acorn](http://flyingmeat.com/acorn/) in 2012.
* [Adobe Photoshop](http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html) - Still the place I do the final tuning of all art, but seem to be using [Pixelmator](http://www.pixelmator.com/) more and more.

## Utilities

* [TextExpander](http://www.smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/) - I never learned to touch type, so this is a life saver. Have snippets for programming, git command lines and all my notes.
* [1Password](https://agilebits.com/onepassword) - No introduction needed, contains all my passwords and data, used to log in to sites because I can never remember which password to use.
* [Dropbox](http://www.dropbox.com/) - Another first install item, because it contains my [1Password](https://agilebits.com/onepassword) and [TextExpander](http://www.smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/) data, as well as enabling me to share files between laptop, desktop and iPad.
* [Growl](http://growl.info/) - So I know what is going on
* [iStat Menus](http://bjango.com/mac/istatmenus/) - Given that I am always running servers on my development boxes, [iStat Menus](http://bjango.com/mac/istatmenus/) tells me when my CPU's are melting or my LAN is getting crushed.
* [Moom](http://manytricks.com/moom/) - A new one for 2011, click and drag to set the window size, or save a keystroke to put the window where you want it every time. I use it to lay out my development windows in the same place every time.
* [Fantastical](http://flexibits.com/fantastical) - Easy to see what is going on and book an appointment. Went back to Apple's [iCal](http://www.apple.com/macosx/apps/#ical) because it was conflicting with my old favorite [BusyCal](http://www.busymac.com/), but maybe its time to go back to that too.

## News

* [Reeder](http://reederapp.com/) - Finally a RSS reader that beats my all time favorite [NetNewsWire](http://netnewswireapp.com/), its elegant and very easy to read. Now that [BlackPixel](http://blackpixel.com/) owns [NetNewsWire](v), I am hoping it comes back.
* [Twitteriffic](http://iconfactory.com/software/twitterrific) - Not sorry, folks, this is still the twitter client to beat, on all platforms, made better with [Tweet Marker](http://tweetmarker.net/).

## Other

* [Billings](http://www.marketcircle.com/billings/) - As a contract indie, I need to track time and bill customers. [Billings](http://www.marketcircle.com/billings/) gets it done, but it has a learning curve. Just wish I could use on more than one computer without buying their server version.
[OmniFocus](http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnifocus/) - Keeping track of all the todos on multiple projects is easy with [OmniFocus](http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnifocus/), and it syncs to all my iDevices as well
* [AppViz 2](http://www.ideaswarm.com/AppViz2.html) - For tracking the sales of mine and my client's iOS apps, just works.
* [join.me](https://join.me/) - A new one, for sharing my screen over the internet to show customers how awesome their products are becoming
* [Code Runner](http://krillapps.com/coderunner/) - Another new toy, allows me to spike scripts and test code before applying it to the project, replaces my massive spikes folder
* [Screenflow](http://www.telestream.net/screen-flow/) - The best way to talk about a product is to show it, and [Screenflow](http://www.telestream.net/screen-flow/) allows me to make great demos.

## Honorable mentions

* [Versions](http://versionsapp.com/) - Love this SVN client, but I moved on to GIT and [GitHub](http://github.com/) this year, so I no longer use it
* [Kaleidoscope](http://www.kaleidoscopeapp.com/) - Nice diffs, including image diffs, wish it had a merge tool too
* [Skitch](http://skitch.com/) - Grab a screen snap and share
* [Coda](http://panic.com/coda/) - Managed my old web sites and my professional PHP one, have most of the [Panic](http://panic.com/) apps too.
* [Espresso](http://macrabbit.com/espresso/) - Since *CSSEdit* is no more, use this for CSS live testing and updates
* [MarsEdit](http://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/) - My old favorite blogging tool, replaced with command line and [Byword](http://bywordapp.com/) when I moved to [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) for this blog.  Will go back to it when they figure out a way to make it work with this.

You may think there are some glaring ommissions like Microsoft Office, no, not had it installed for almost 6 months now, [iWork](http://www.apple.com/iwork/) does it all. Still on [VMWare Fusion](http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/overview.html) for VM's. And still cannot get in to [Evernote](http://www.evernote.com/), no matter how hard I try to like it.

It's been a great year in Mac Apps, looking forward to all the cool new toys in 2012.
