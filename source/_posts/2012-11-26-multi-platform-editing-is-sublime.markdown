One of the best things about the [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) license is that it's a per-user license. This allows you to run it on all computers where you are the primary user. And since Sublime Text 2 is multi-platform, that means on *all* the operating systems you use as well.

For example, in my case, I can and do run Sublime Text 2 on

* My laptop Macintosh which is my regular workhorse.
* My OS X Server for maintaining Slogger and other scheduled scripts.
* My Windows 7 VM which is where I do all my Windows coding and testing.
* And on all my GUI Linux VMs too.

No more jumping between *TextMate*, *UltraEdit*, and *GEdit*. Or worse, having to use *Notepad* because nothing else is installed.

I have also started to use the portable version from a thumb-drive when going out to client sites and installing software on their locked up, firewalled Windows computers. Just pop in the thumb-drive and launch, a preconfigured working editing environment fully customized for our use.

All these installs have the same [setup](https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/08/14/my-sublime-text-2-setup/), [themes](https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/11/07/multiple-themes-in-sublime-text-2/) and plugins (Beware: a few of the plugins fail on Windows). Which means we users can get a consistent editing interface and environment everywhere we work. Just great.

Vim users have had this kind of portability for a while, but now us GUI editing fiends can have the same.
