In [TimeToCall - After One Month](https://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/03/07/timetocall-after-one-month/), I stated that my next *marketing* experiment would be to send a PR style email to popular press site tip lines to see if they worked. In parallel, and unbeknownst to me, Christian Tietze was doing the same thing, just paying for it  <span class="light">(See [Sales and AppLaunch.us experience for Calendar Paste](http://christiantietze.de/posts/2013/03/calendarpaste-sales-and-applaunch/), worth a read and reminding me to post this).</span>

The results are:

* `12` PR messages sent  <span class="light">(see the actual message sent at the bottom of this post)</span>
* `1` delivery failure (so I used a backup address)
* `2` robo-responders indicating that the emails were received, thank you
* `0` reviews
* `0` posts about the product
* `0` requests for promo codes
* `0` responses
* `0` sales

To be clear, I do not blame any of these folks for the lack of response (and I did not really expect any). They get *hundreds* of PR messages like mine every day. They are good people trying their best to sift through a **morass of messy messages** to find the gems that would interest and delight their readers. Either my message did not stand out, did not resonate, got nailed by a spam catcher somewhere, or was just not the kind of thing they thought would work for their readership. I'm OK with that because I understand *their* situation. I knew this going in to the experiment.

Unfortunately, Christian paid for his PR. I think that if one is *paying*, one should get a better response than free and none. In his data (see the chart in his [article](http://christiantietze.de/posts/2013/03/calendarpaste-sales-and-applaunch/)) I see the sales spikes he got from [Brett Terpstra's review](http://brettterpstra.com/2012/12/18/calendar-paste-scheduling-made-easy/) and the [press reviews](http://www.cultofmac.com/210994/take-better-charge-of-your-calendar-with-calendar-paste-review/) he got a week later via his own direct interpersonal relationships. But I do not see any as a result of the paid press release that went out blind.

**In short, the lesson learned is that blindly sending PR emails to even the best industry sites simply does not work. I think you need to have a personal relationship with someone at each place or build your own online presence for them to find and follow you.**

I guess it's time to step away from the screen and start getting to know the good folks in the press *personally*. First drink is on me.

## Aside: The message that was sent

I followed the advice of the folks at the App Design Vault in [The Ultimate Cheat Sheet for Getting iPhone App Reviews](http://www.appdesignvault.com/iphone-app-reviews/) and made it look like   
Christopher Phin's [anatomy of a perfect press release](https://twitter.com/chrisphin/status/308672663650463744) example.

In order to get attention, I also

* Referred to the post series on how it was made, hoping that would interest these writers to learn about what is behind the products they review all the time.
* Included a [Brett Terpstra](http://brettterpstra.com/2013/02/09/an-ios-development-saga-timetocall/) quote because everybody knows he's a software wizard.
* I even made a [press kit](https://hiltmon.com/timetocall/press-kit.html), so the art and assets were easily accessible.

So here it is, an image of the PR message sent:
