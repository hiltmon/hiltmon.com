I am writing a lot of business documents in [Scrivener](http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php), and even though it's the wrong way to do it, I use Scrivener's format presets (think paragraph styles) to quickly format headings, bulleted lists and paragraphs in each sub-document. This way I minimize post-processing <span class="light">(and the business format is intentionally boring so I do not need any fancy layouts)</span>.

But it's a hassle to have to take my hands off the keyboard to click through the **Format** /** Apply Formatting** / **Apply Preset** menu tree or hit the tiny format preset dropdown `Â¶a` to set the current paragraph style. What I want is a single key-combination to apply a preset style.

Here's how I made it happen.

### Create your Format Presets

The first thing you need is to create the Format Presets you want to use.

To create a preset:

* Select the *paragraph* you want to format.
* Set the font, size, etc using the toolbar
* With the paragraph still selected, choose **Format** / **Formatting** / **New Preset from Selection** from the menus and give it a name. *Make sure this name is unique to the application, this is key.*
* Click **OK** when done.

You should now see the new preset with your name on the preset drop down and in the **Format** / **Formatting** / **Apply Preset** menu.

To manually apply this preset to another paragraph, select the new paragraph and then click the new preset off the menu.

### Create the Keyboard Shortcuts

Open **System Preferences**, choose **Keyboard** and select the **Shortcuts** tab. Click on **App Shortcuts** on the left.



To add a new Scrivener Shortcut:

* Click the **Plus** Button
* Select the Application - Scrivener
* Type in the name of the format preset. *Note: The name must match the format preset exactly, one character difference and this will not work.*
* Hit the keyboard shortcut you wish to use {% img right /images/scrivener-format-menu.png 283 250 %}
* Click **Add** to save


To see if this worked, click on the **Format** / **Formatting** / **Apply Preset** menu in Scrivener and you should see your new keyboard shortcuts on the menu next to their names.

### All Done

So now you can focus on writing in Scrivener and format paragraphs without leaving the keyboard.
