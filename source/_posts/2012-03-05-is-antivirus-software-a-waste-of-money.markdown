Not astonishing at all in Wired's [Is Antivirus Software a Waste of Money?](http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2012/03/antivirus/) by Robert McMillan:

{% blockquote %}
He doesn’t use antivirus software.  As it turns out, many of his security-minded peers don’t use it either. The reason: If someone is going to try and attack them, they’re likely to use a new technique, one that most antivirus products will miss. “If you asked the average security expert whether they use antivirus or not,” Grossman says “a significant proportion of them do not.”
{% endblockquote %}

AntiVirus software is like the TSA, an annoyance that chews up money and time and tells the bad guys what *not* to do, leaving an infinite number of possible things they *can* do which the AV/TSA will *never* notice.
