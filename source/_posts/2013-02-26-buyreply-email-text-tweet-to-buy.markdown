Prior to online purchases, the only innovation in purchasing was credit cards. The move to online electronic purchasing has seen only one more real innovation, 1-click by Amazon. The current online purchasing experience really just replicates the same onerous manual purchasing process thatâ€™s been around since money was invented.

Until now.

With [BuyReply](http://www.buyreply.com/), purchasing is as far away as an email, text or tweet. Completely frictionless. Completely effortless. Available everywhere.

Here's how it works. A vendor *pops* an easy-to-remember email address, SMS number or Twitter handle and a short code, usually a simple word like "LASER" or "DONATE". You email, text or tweet that code word to the given address and [BuyReply](http://www.buyreply.com/) sends you a link to register your payment info and shipping details. They then save this in your online wallet for future purchases. Purchase made. That's it.

The next time you use email, text or tweet to buy, [BuyReply's](http://www.buyreply.com/) online [wallet](http://www.buyreply.com/wallet) remembers your details and all you need to do it tap the confirmation link they send you to buy the next product. *No more checkout, no more nags or up-sells, no more re-enter your details, no more decline to join the mailing lists, no more next, next, next; **just tap and it's bought**.* You can visit your [wallet](http://www.buyreply.com/wallet) on the web to see your purchase history in one place.

I've been beta testing this for a while now and I think it is great. I'm using it for the "Support with a Donation" links on this site. [BuyReply](http://www.buyreply.com/) has created a completely new and unique way for us to purchase and for vendors to reach us. By making it easier for us to buy, it means we will be buying more. And best of all, it's frictionless, the process does not create any more work on our end.

[BuyReply](http://www.buyreply.com/) has gone from *patented* idea to full implementation in just over one year. Its CEO (and my very good friend) Brad Lindenberg ([@bradlind](https://twitter.com/bradlind)) previously built a very successful business selling custom golf clubs and has turned his incredible entrepreneurial drive and all his time and effort into making this happen. They already have several major names signed up, a proper revenue plan and I expect us to all hear a lot more about [BuyReply](http://www.buyreply.com/) going forward.

**Note**: The SMS, tweets, email and links above are *real* and work, you can not only *try* them but *actually* send me real money via [BuyReply](http://www.buyreply.com/). We set up a [BuyReply Merchant Account](http://www.buyreply.com/merchant), linked up [Stripe](http://www.stripe.com) for payments, added the `DONATE` keyword (and to make it complicated we added different support levels) and established the links to text, Twitter, email and direct. It was easy, the merchant interface is very clear and simple, and it took less than 1 hour to set it all up and take in the first transaction.

So check out [BuyReply](http://www.buyreply.com/) on the web, sign up as a merchant if you sell things, and look for the orange-arrow logo on sites and billboards near you. *I think this is the next big thing in online commerce.*

<span class="light">*Disclaimer*: I am not an investor in [BuyReply](http://www.buyreply.com/). **I wish I was.** I am just a friend of Brad's who loves the idea and the product, uses it and wants you all to know about it and use it too.</span>
