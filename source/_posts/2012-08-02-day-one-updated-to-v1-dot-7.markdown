My favorite journaling application [Day One](http://dayoneapp.com) has been updated for both Mac and iOS.  Amongst the best new features are photo’s, location checkins using Foursquare and weather.  They have also updated the markdown engine. I use it all day to capture what I do as well as log all my activities (such as creating this post or committing code, see [Bread crumbs in Day One - The Hiltmon](http://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/01/23/bread-crumbs-in-day-one/)).

Since this new version is sandboxed, the command line client has been moved. You now have to download and install it manually from [here](http://dayoneapp.com/tools/). After that, all scripts will work just fine again.

I’m thinking of using the new photos feature to just capture moments that I used to capture in Instagram, but this time the data remains mine.
