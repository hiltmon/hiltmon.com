Lovely article by Jason Cohen, worth a read, called [Your idea sucks, now go do it anyway](http://blog.asmartbear.com/your-idea-sucks-now-go-do-it-anyway.html) makes a great point on how the original idea for something usually evolves into something completely different, and success comes from embracing that evolution.

{% blockquote %}
“My idea isn’t good enough yet” explained a friend who is thinking of starting his own company. He’s waiting for the idea to be completely fleshed out before taking the leap.

Newsflash: Your idea probably sucks, and it doesn’t matter because your business will probably turn out to be something completely different.
{% endblockquote %}

I often find myself talking to people about their their software ideas, and my usual response is "go for it", even if I do not wish to participate. Some of the examples in the [article](http://blog.asmartbear.com/your-idea-sucks-now-go-do-it-anyway.html) prove that the original idea may have sucked, but by going for it, by adapting as they learned more about the idea and its use cases, by evolving the idea, they were successful. You'll know their names.

Pursue your ideas. Know that they will evolve into something unexpected. Pursue the evolution. At worst, you'll gain some experience and go nowhere. At best, you'll be the next big thing.
