We need to keep pushing forward without them, and do what we’ve always done before: route around the obstructions and maintain what’s great about the web. Keep building and supporting new tools, technologies, and platforms to empower independence, interoperability, and web property ownership.
{% endblockquote %}

The context is how the big internet companies like Facebook, Twitter and Google have locked down the open internet, and that we need to overcome their new barriers and keep building so that we can keep the great internet we know and love.

But I think this message applies to more than just the internet, it applies to work and play and socialization and life. We need to keep doing what we did to get to where we are today, to keep building, to overcome the obstructions and maintain what's great about our lifestyles. We need to keep up the effort on freedom, rights, openness, the environment, and anything else that is big and important in our lives. With an open internet, we *can* do it, we *should*  do it.
