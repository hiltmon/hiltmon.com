Matt "Legend" Gemmell, writing in [Opinions in Journalism](http://mattgemmell.com/2011/12/28/opinions-in-journalism/) summarizes and continues recent internet discussions on how Tech Journalism has become too bland, impartial and hedged:

{% blockquote %}
...as readers, we’re often looking for insight to help with a buying decision, rather than raw information.
{% endblockquote %}

As Ben Brooks sees it in [Family Apple](http://brooksreview.net/2011/12/apple-sissling/) (via [Hugh Sissling](http://www.woooster.co.uk/post/14922514968/family-apple)):

{% blockquote %}
More surprising is that no one asked me which phone or computer to get — they just wanted to know which iPad to get and if they should wait for the next iPad.
{% endblockquote %}

Not *one* product review I have seen has been honest enough to say that the reader should stop wasting their time reading this \<insert other tablet name here\> review and just get an iPad.

If our family members know, so should the press.
