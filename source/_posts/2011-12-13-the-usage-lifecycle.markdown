Joshua Porter writes about the Usage Lifecycle in [Designing for the Social Web: The Usage Lifecycle](http://bokardo.com/archives/designing-for-the-social-web-the-usage-lifecycle/), well worth reading.

The stages in the Usage Lifecycle of a product are:

{% blockquote %}
	•	<strong>Unaware</strong> This isn’t so much a stage as it is a starting point. Most people are in this stage: completely unaware of your product.
	•	<strong>Interested</strong> These people are interested in your product, but are not yet users. They have lots of questions about how it works and what value it provides.
	•	<strong>First-time Use</strong> These people are using your software for the first time, a crucial moment in their progression.
	•	<strong>Regular Use</strong> These people are those who use your software regularly and perhaps pay for the privilege.
	•	<strong>Passionate Use</strong> These people are the ultimate goal: passionate users who spread their passion and build a community around your software
{% endblockquote %}

I have two products launching soon, so we're at the **unaware** stage.  Working hard on creating the materials to move people to **interested** stage.  The goal as always, **passionate use**.
