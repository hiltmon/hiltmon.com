If you use markdown like I do on a Mac, you *may* notice that [Quick Look](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quick_Look) does not render `.markdown` files as documents, instead providing an icon only. If you have tools like [iAWriter](http://www.iawriter.com/) installed (I used to), they install a Quick Look plugin, and the markdown is rendered readable.

For the rest of us, Brett Terpstra of [Marked](http://brettterpstra.com/project/marked/) and [nvAlt](http://brettterpstra.com/project/nvalt/) fame has released an update to [Fletcher Penney's](http://fletcherpenney.net/) [Quick Look](https://github.com/fletcher/MMD-QuickLook) generator.

Check it out at [Multimarkdown Quick Look With Style](http://brettterpstra.com/multimarkdown-quick-look-with-style/). I'm using it.
