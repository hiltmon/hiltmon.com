*If you are running OS X 10.8 or lower, please refer to [SonicWall NetExtender for OS X Mavericks](http://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/09/28/sonicwall-netextender-for-os-x-mavericks/), this only works for 10.9 Mavericks and above.*

Step 1: Download from the App Store

It's available here: [Sonicwall Mobile Connect](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sonicwall-mobile-connect/id822514576?mt=12&uo=4&at=10l894).

There is no Step 2.

The best part of this new edition is that this is a real OS X app and it integrates with Apple's VPN settings.

Which means you only need to run it once, to set up and test the VPN connection. After that, you can access it from the **Network** System Preference or the **VPN** menu at any time.

**Tip**: If the Apple version of the VPN does not work, try again via the [Sonicwall Mobile Connect](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sonicwall-mobile-connect/id822514576?mt=12&uo=4&at=10l894) app. When it asks you to accept the expired certificate, click **Show Certificate**, then choose **Trust** from the popups. Enter your password and the Apple VPN version will work from then on.

I have also been told that some older SonicWall's may not be supported, so I cannot guarantee this will work for you.
