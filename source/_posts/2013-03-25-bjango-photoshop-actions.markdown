I've already pointed out that you *must have* [Slicy](https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/07/11/slicy-photoshop-artwork/) when working in Photoshop to create and manage iOS artwork or when creating assets for web sites.

The other *must have not-so-secret weapon* for iOS art is Bjango's [iOS and Android Photoshop Actions & Workflows](http://bjango.com/articles/actions/). These are a set of Photoshop actions that speed up the creation and scaling of iOS artwork.

I start all iOS screen designs using the blue actions that create the necessary blank screen files (they even create a nice status bar). And I test the scaling of all icons using the green scaling actions which scale to *all* the required and supported sizes.

But the actions I use the most are the `Scale by 200%` and `Scale by 50%` that enable me to switch between regular and retina sizes to see how lines and curves shift.

Of course, I don't use the slice tools as I use proper Photoshop folder and item naming to work with [Slicy](https://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/07/11/slicy-photoshop-artwork/).

These actions are free, well maintained and can be downloaded from [iOS and Android Photoshop Actions & Workflows](http://bjango.com/articles/actions/). Installation instructions are included in the download.
