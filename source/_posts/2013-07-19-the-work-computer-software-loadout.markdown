I got [Back in the Saddle](http://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/06/25/back-in-the-saddle/) over three weeks ago and purchased a new Haswell 13-inch MacBook Air as my primary work computer. I plan to write more about it after at least 30 days use. But with the new computer, my plan was to only install that which I needed *as and when* I needed it. It turns out, I use a lot of different tools for work activities.

## Primary Uses

The primary uses for this work computer are:

* **Programming** new systems using a myriad of languages and tools, mostly via terminal, TextMate 2 and Xcode, to be run on Centos Servers against many different database servers. See [A Simple C++ Project Structure](http://hiltmon.com/blog/2013/07/03/a-simple-c-plus-plus-project-structure/).
* **Designing** the new systems, from mind mapping, through diagramming, through wire-framing and artwork creation and, of course, writing documentation.
* **Maintaining** a bunch of older web applications and moving them to newer technologies (and creating a bunch of new ones)
* **Systems administration** of the servers, databases and routers of the business
* The usual work-like things such as emails, contacts, calendaring and communications

## Launchpad Pages

Page 1 of my [Launchpad](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5548) contains all the default Apple applications, with the addition of [iWork](http://www.apple.com/iwork/) and [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/):

Quick notes:

* **Safari** is my *primary* web browser
* **Mail** is where I run all my email accounts
* **iMessage** is running for chats and IM
* **Contacts** manages my address book
* **Calendar** stores my calendar, but I use [Fantastical](http://flexibits.com/fantastical) on the menu bar to manage it
* **Keynote** is the only [iWork](http://www.apple.com/iwork/) app I have used so far on this new machine

Page 2 and 3 contain all my third party applications. Yes, in *alphabetical* order of course!

## Dock and Menu Bar

{% img /images/work-dock.jpg 700 57 %}

For the apps I like to drop things on or click to launch, and really because they have just habitually been on the dock:

- **Finder**, always first
- **LaunchPad**, because I forget what I have installed
- **Mail**, for all accounts
- **Safari**, for all web browsing
- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/), for when I need flash or an alternate login to the same site
- [iTerm 2](http://www.iterm2.com/#/section/home), for all my local and remote terminal needs
- [BBEdit](http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/index.html), for notes and text manipulation
- [TextMate 2](http://macromates.com), for programming
- [Tweetbot](http://tapbots.com/software/tweetbot/)
- [Kiwi](http://kiwi-app.net)
- **iMessage**
- **System Preferences**, because I always forget they are on the Apple menu
- [OmniFocus](http://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus), to see what to do next

{% img /images/work-menu-bar.jpg 683 48 %}

* [Fantastical](http://flexibits.com/fantastical) for calendaring, never hidden
* In Bartender
	* [Tweetbot](http://tapbots.com/software/tweetbot/)
	* [TextExpander](http://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/index.html)

	* Networking
	* Memory
	* CPU's

I could, and will, remove **PixelMator**, **VoodooPad** and the **Qt** system as I am not using them anymore (replaced by **Photoshop**, **BBEdit** files and new code).  I'd also would dearly like to toss **Microsoft Office**, but the finance industry runs on it and there are some files only it can open.

The two things that I am missing *natively* is a a copy of **XenCenter** that runs on OS X to manage server virtualization, I need to run that on a VMWare VM; and a ***native* SQL Server** database access tool. If I find a good one then **Xamarin** and **Mono** can go as well. Too bad [SQL Grinder](http://www.sqlgrinder.com) died with the Objective-C/Java bridge.

Using all these tools, I have been able to launch straight into the work at the new firm, and start off very productively. There is not much I *cannot* do with this loadout and laptop.
