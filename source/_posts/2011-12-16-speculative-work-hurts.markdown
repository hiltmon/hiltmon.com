[Sebastiaan de With](https://twitter.com/#!/sdw), a really great designer, posts on Facebook of all places on [how speculative work hurts the design industry at large](http://www.facebook.com/sdewith/posts/213110135435417).

Happens in software too, where clients expect you to plan, document and design the software before entering into a contract.
