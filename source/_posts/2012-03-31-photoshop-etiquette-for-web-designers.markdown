There is a brilliant list of things web designers *should* be doing when desiging web apps in PhotoShop at [the photoshop etiquette manifesto for web designers](http://photoshopetiquette.com/). Do these and we developers will have a much easier time implementing your designs.

Applies to iOS app designers, Mac App designers, in fact any app designers too.

From now on, all my designers will be asked to follow these rules.
