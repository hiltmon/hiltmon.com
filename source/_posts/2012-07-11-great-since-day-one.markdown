Marco Arment nails it in [Great since day one](http://www.marco.org/2010/07/04/great-since-day-one):

{% blockquote %}
I never make technology-buying decisions based on future promises, rumors, or potential.
{% endblockquote %}

and 

{% blockquote %}
I buy things that are great today. They’re usually things that have been great since day one. And, more often than not, they’re Apple products.
{% endblockquote %}

I agree with Marco, I buy what I need *now*, so I can be productive *now*. 

I do not understand how folks can put up with the frustration with what they have, the inability to get things done or the doing without by waiting for something that may never happen. In my case, not waiting led to:

* The best laptop ever, the Titanium PowerBook, purchased a few weeks before the Aluminum PowerBooks were *announced*, because I needed a new laptop, 6 years excellent service.
* My favorite monitor, the Apple 23" Cinema HD, purchased a few months before the new Apple metal monitors were *announced* in 2004, because I needed an bigger and better display. I am still using it today to write this post. Apple has since released the 24", the 27", the 30", the mini-displayport ones and the thunderbolt one, but this monitor is still going strong.
