I totally agree with [Marco](http://twitter.com/marcoarment) in [Avoiding the blogger trap](http://www.marco.org/2009/04/05/avoiding-the-blogger-trap):

{% blockquote %}
People aren’t so one-sided. Everyone has a life that goes much deeper than the topics on their blogs.
{% endblockquote %}

and

{% blockquote %}
This site represents me, and I’m random and eccentric and interested in a wide variety of subjects.
{% endblockquote %}

*This* site is **me**, with a *hodge podge* of posts ranging from opinion pieces, news, geeky ideas, advice, links, jokes, setups and productivity. I write what I find interesting. I experiment. Sometimes I have a point. Sometimes I just want to provoke thought. And allegedly I even occasionally produce a good and useful post.

I don't make any money from this. I don't get any new business from this (as yet, still hoping).

I do care about my readers. I like to engage with you, and get very excited every time I get an email from [Disqus](https://disqus.com) to say a new comment has been posted. Or a [Twitter](http://https://twitter.com/hiltmon) or [App.Net](http://alpha.app.net/hiltmon) mention. Or a [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/hiltmoncom) page like. And the best is when another blogger links to my work.

I like to write. And I intend to continue writing. Maybe I'll even get better at it.

But most importantly, **thank you** for reading **Hiltmon.com** and coming along on the journey. I hope you continue to enjoy it.

"Good Journey."
