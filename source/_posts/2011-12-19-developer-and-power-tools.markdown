Justin Williams has a pretty good list of tools he uses both for daily use and for development in [My Ultimate Developer and Power Users Tool List for Mac OS X (2011 Edition)](http://carpeaqua.com/2011/12/19/my-ultimate-developer-and-power-users-tool-list-for-mac-os-x-2011-edition-/).

I have quite a few of the same, but several key differences:

* *Acorn* I have, but use Photoshop, Illustrator and [Pixelmator](http://www.pixelmator.com/) a lot more
* [BBedit](http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/) is open all the time, but I use [TextMate](http://macromates.com/) for programming (already switched to Textmate 2 Alpha)
* [Appviz](http://www.ideaswarm.com/AppViz2.html) instead of *Appfigures*
* The great [Kaleidoscope](http://www.kaleidoscopeapp.com/) for file compares instead of *Changes*
* Tossing up between [Coda](http://panic.com/coda/) (my old favorite) and [Espresso 2](http://macrabbit.com/espresso/) (because I think the old *CSSEdit* was the best)
* [Skitch](http://skitch.com/) for snapping instead of *LittleSnapper* (use only for storing well designed web pages, though thinking of going back now that Evernote owns Skitch)
* [Fantastical](http://flexibits.com/fantastical) instead of *Today*

New to me:

* *Coderunner*, *HTTP Client* and *Patterns* (used to just have additional terminal windows open - purchased them)

Missing:

* [Billings](http://www.marketcircle.com/billings/) for time management
* [OmniGraffle](http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnigraffle/) for diagramming
* [Scrivener](http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php) for writing large and complex documents

After the holidays, I think I'll write a more comprehensive post on the tools I use and why.
