Jason Fried, on the 37 Signals blog, sums it up in [What clarity is all about](http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3144-what-clarity-is-all-about):

{% blockquote %}
Lots of people think simplicity is the opposite of confusion (“It’s confusing, let’s make this simpler”). It’s not. The opposite of confusion is clarity.
{% endblockquote %}
