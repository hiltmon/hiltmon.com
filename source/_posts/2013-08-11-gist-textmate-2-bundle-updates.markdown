New updates to the [Gist.tmbundle](https://github.com/hiltmon/Gist.tmbundle) for TextMate 2:

* Changed the launch key from `⌃⌘G` to `⇧⌃⌘J` as it interferes with the Find and Replace All (the TextMate 2 defaults changed)
* Am now having GitHub guess the language of a "Gist from Selection" by taking the file extension from the source file you copied from and using that in the pushed file name. Was hoping to use the scope language but could not figure how to get that and map the right extensions for GitHub. This works though.

The update should flow through the TextMate 2 updates process in due time.
