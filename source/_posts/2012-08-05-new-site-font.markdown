I love [Octopress](http://octopress.org), but I have never been happy with the default fonts. The default [PT Sans](http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/PT+Sans) and [PT Serif](http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/PT+Serif) fonts are very, very nice, but not awesome. I did like the X and Y height, the clarity, the ease of reading, but the letterspacing on the serif font was too tight and it started to look jaggy.

This week, Adobe released [Source Sans Pro](http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2012/08/source-sans-pro.html), their first free and open font, and I think itâ€™s great for a technical blog-style web site. The letterforms are large, well spaced, and just perfect for screen reading, as the font was designed for user interfaces.

So Hiltmon.com is now using [Source Sans Pro](http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro) with the default Octopress layout. What do you think?
