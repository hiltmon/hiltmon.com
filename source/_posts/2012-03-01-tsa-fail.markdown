Steve Moore, an experienced ex-FBI Counterterrorist Agent writing in [TSA: Fail](http://gmancasefile.blogspot.com/2012/01/tsa-fail.html):

{% blockquote %}
The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) was formed to ensure America’s freedom to travel.  Instead, they have made air travel the most difficult means of mass transit in the United States, at the same time failing to make air travel any more secure.

TSA has never, (and I invite them to prove me wrong), foiled a terrorist plot or stopped an attack on an airliner. Ever.
{% endblockquote %}

The truth, unfortunately, is not going to change things.
