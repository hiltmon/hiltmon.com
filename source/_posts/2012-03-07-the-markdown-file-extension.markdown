The correct file extension for markdown files is:

`.markdown`
	
That is all. No others.

Make it so!

I suppose I'd better say why:

* We no longer live in a 8.3 world, so we should be using the most descriptive file extensions. It's sad that all our operating systems rely on this stupid convention instead of the better creator code or a metadata model, but great that they now support longer file extensions.
* **Markdown is text but text is not markdown**. It's a few seconds work to associate an application to edit text and another to edit markdown files, so use that. I use different editors for them, so its best to help the operating system here.
* `.md` (a.k.a the GitHub extension) could be mistaken for GCC Machine Description files, confusion is bad, don't do it.
* All the others are just shortened forms on the canonical `.markdown`, so use the canon. Avoid `.mdown`, `.mkdn`, `.mdn` or even the horrible `.mdtext`.
* If you have made the mistake in the past of using the *wrong* file extension, write a script to rename the old files now. Ok, now run it. Good. Problem solved.
