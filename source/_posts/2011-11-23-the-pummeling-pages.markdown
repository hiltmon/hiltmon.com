{% blockquote %}
They’re filled with ads and social-media sharing buttons — and more ads. And Google plus-onesies and Facebook likeys. And also more ads. Plus tweet-this-es. Plus ads. (And, under-the-hood, a whole cruise-ship-full of analytics. The page required well-more than 100 http calls.)

No wonder we all like [InstaPaper](http://www.instapaper.com/) and Safari's Reader mode.
