My name is **Hilton Lipschitz**, but everybody calls me **hiltmon**.  I am the designer, consultant,  programmer, and owner of [Noverse LLC](http://www.noverse.com), an independent iOS (iPad, iPhone and iPod Touch), Macintosh (OS X) and Web (Ruby on Rails) product development company, based in New York, USA.

My background is varied: born in South Africa, bred in Australia, lived in Japan and now in New York.  I have been a programmer for over 22 years, a project manager on some large and complex projects in the 1990's and more recently, a CTO at two hedge funds.  Having been there and done that, I decided over 2 years ago to go indie, to consult, to make my own products and to help others make amazing brilliant software products.

I have released one awesome web product so far:

[Kifu](http://www.kifuapp.com), an online application to help manage your community, its events and finances. Take a look at [http://www.kifuapp.com](http://www.kifuapp.com) for more details.

On the iOS side:

[TimeToCall]({{ root_url }}/timetocall/) is an iPhone and iPad app to show you the best time to call overseas. Play with time to find the right time across a wide variety of places.

If you live in Australia or New Zealand, grab the [oo.com.au](http://itunes.apple.com/au/app/oo-com-au/id422693241) iPhone app, allowing you to browse and purchase the great products offered by [oo.com.au](http://www.oo.com.au).

I have also released a whole bunch of free code, bundles and themes for developers to share, see my [code]({{ root_url }}/code/) page.
