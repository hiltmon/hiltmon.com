My name is **Hilton Lipschitz**, but everybody calls me **hiltmon**.  I am the designer, consultant,  programmer, and owner of [Noverse LLC](http://www.noverse.com), an independent iOS(iPad, iPhone and iPod Touch), Macintosh (OS X) and Web (Ruby on Rails) product development company, based in New York, USA.

My background is varied, born in South Africa, bred in Australia, lived in Japan and now in New York.  I have been a programmer for over 21 years, a project manager on some large and complex projects in the 1990's and more recently, a CTO at two hedge funds.  Having been there and done that, I decided 2 years ago to go indie, to make my own products and to help others make amazing brilliant software products.

I am currently working on two absolutely awesome web products.  As soon as they launch, I'll link to them here.

If you live in Australia or New Zealand, grab the [oo.com.au](http://itunes.apple.com/au/app/oo-com-au/id422693241) iPhone app, allowing you to browse and purchase the great products offered by [oo.com.au](http://www.oo.com.au).

I also have a few old iOS applications on the App Store, [Sights to See](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sights-to-see/id386858857?mt=8) is an iPhone app for building your own travel guidebook and saving location maps so you can travel without using roaming data, and [Emergency List](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/emergency-list/id358546814?mt=8), a *free* quick dial app.
