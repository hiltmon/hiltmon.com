My name is **Hilton Lipschitz**, but everybody calls me **hiltmon**.  I am the designer, consultant,  programmer, and owner of [Noverse LLC](http://www.noverse.com), an independent iOS (iPad, iPhone and iPod Touch), Macintosh (OS X) and Web (Ruby on Rails) product development company, based in New York, USA.

My background is varied, born in South Africa, bred in Australia, lived in Japan and now in New York.  I have been a programmer for over 21 years, a project manager on some large and complex projects in the 1990's and more recently, a CTO at two hedge funds.  Having been there and done that, I decided over 2 years ago to go indie, to make my own products and to help others make amazing brilliant software products.

I am currently working on two absolutely awesome web products:

* The first is [Kifu](http://www.kifuapp.com), an online application to help manage your community, its events and finances. Take a look at [http://www.kifuapp.com](http://www.kifuapp.com) for more details.
* The second is under development, and when it's up, I'll link to it here.

On the iOS side:

* If you live in Australia or New Zealand, grab the [oo.com.au](http://itunes.apple.com/au/app/oo-com-au/id422693241) iPhone app, allowing you to browse and purchase the great products offered by [oo.com.au](http://www.oo.com.au).
* I had a few old iOS applications on the App Store, *but took them down recently as they no longer showcase my talents*. They were:
	* *Sights to See* was an iPhone app for building your own travel guidebook and saving location maps so you can travel without using roaming data
	* *Emergency List* was a free quick dial app for your iPhone.

You can get in touch with me using any of the methods below. **Note**: If you’re interested in contacting me for business reasons (such as enquiring about my [development services](http://www.noverse.com/services.php), please instead use the contact information on my [business site, Noverse.com](http://www.noverse.com)).
