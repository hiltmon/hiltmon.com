My name is **Hilton Lipschitz**, but everybody calls me **hiltmon**.

Currently, I am Chief Technology Officer (CTO) in an awesome small, growing New York Hedge Fund, designing and building the most amazing trading technology ever. Before this, I was the designer, consultant,  programmer, and owner of [Noverse LLC](http://www.noverse.com), an independent iOS (iPad, iPhone and iPod Touch), Macintosh (OS X) and Web (Ruby on Rails) product development company, based in New York, USA.

My background is varied: born in South Africa, bred in Australia, lived in Japan and now in New York.  I have been a programmer for over 25 years, a project manager on some large and complex projects in the 1990's and more recently, a CTO at two (now three) hedge funds.  Having been there and done that, I decided over 5 years ago to go indie, to consult, to make my own products and to help others make amazing brilliant software products.

And then I got back into the game.

I have released a whole bunch of free code, bundles and themes for developers to share, see my [code]({{ root_url }}/code/) page.
