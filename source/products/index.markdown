Here are *some* of the products that I have developed, for clients or for sale, directly or through my company [Noverse LLC](http://www.noverse.com). <span class="light">Unfortunately, my Hedge Fund clients prefer to remain anonymous, so their work cannot be included.</span> To see my free projects, check out my [code]({{ root_url }}/code/) page.

If you want to hire me for your own development projects, Hedge Fund, web, Macintosh or iOS, check out my business, [Noverse LLC](http://www.noverse.com).
